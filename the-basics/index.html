<p>This is version 3.<script type="text/javascript">document.write(latestMinorVersion);</script>.
See <a href="../meta/versioning.html">Versioning</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This site contains all the information you need to play the game. This page starts you off with a quick overview of
how the game works and then jumps right into the details. After you read it, click through to the rest of the site to
see the options for creating heroes and villains.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-GET-STARTED">GET STARTED</h3>
<p>This site provides a framework for your imagination. It has rules to help determine what happens in your stories and
to resolve conflicts between characters and the challenges they face. With it, you can experience adventure as a hero
fighting against the forces of evil! Any adventure you can imagine is possible.</p>
<p>Like all games, this one too has rules. This page looks at the basic rules of the game and how they work, giving you
the foundation upon which the rest of the game is built.</p>
<p>In this game, you take on the role of a costumed superhero safeguarding the world from threats ranging from scheming
super-criminals to alien invasions, hulking monsters, natural disasters, and would-be conquerors.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-USING-THIS-SITE">USING THIS SITE</h3>
<p>The best way to use this site depends on whether you plan to be a player or Gamemaster in your game. The Gamemaster
creates the world in which the heroes live and controls all non-player characters (NPCs) such as thugs, cops, and
supervillains, as well as the supporting cast. Each player controls a superhero he or she has created, interacting with
other player characters as well as with the world and stories created by the Gamemaster.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-WHAT-YOU-NEED-TO-PLAY">WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY</h3>
<p>Here's what you need to start playing this game:</p>
<ul>
<li>This website, which contains all of the rules necessary to create a hero and play the game.</li>
<li>A character sheet (available on the <a href="../secret-origins/point-counter.html">Make Your Own</a> page or via
<a href="http://grfiles.game-host.org/3e_files/MnM3_ChararacterSheet.pdf">www.mutantsandmasterminds.com</a>.)</li>
<li>A pencil and some paper.</li>
<li>At least three Fudge dice (which looks like <img src="../images/fudge-die.jpg" style="height:36px;width:36px;display:inline" />)
although substitutions can be made (see below). They are available from any game or hobby retailer. You may want to have
three dice for each player, or you can share them.</li>
<li>Optionally, you may wish to have any kind of reference material such as <b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b>
books available from <a href="http://www.greenronin.com/" target="_blank">Green Ronin Publishing</a> (but they are not
required in order to play or run a game and some conversions to H&amp;H may be necessary).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-THE-DICE">THE DICE
<img src="../images/fudge-die.jpg" style="height:36px;width:36px;display:inline" />
<img src="../images/fudge-die.jpg" style="height:36px;width:36px;display:inline" />
<img src="../images/fudge-die.jpg" style="height:36px;width:36px;display:inline" /></h3>
<p>This game uses 3 Fudge dice to resolve actions during the game. Whenever the mechanics refer to "dice" it always is
referring to 3 Fudge dice. The dice is often abbreviated "3dF" (this is standard dice notation where the "F" stands for
Fudge). So a rule asking you to "roll 3dF" means, "roll 3 Fudge dice."</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-11">DICE SUBSTITUTION</h3>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Although 3 Fudge dice should not be too hard to obtain, some people would prefer to reuse ordinary 6 sided dice that
they already own. For a simple conversion have 1 and 2 become -1, 3 and 4 become 0, and 5 and 6 become +1.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-MODIFIERS">MODIFIERS</h3>
<p>Sometimes modifiers to the dice roll are specified like this: "3dF+2," meaning "roll 3 Fudge dice and add 2 to the sum of the numbers rolled." An abbreviation of "3dF-4" means, "roll the dice and subtract 4 from the result."</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-PLAYERS">PLAYERS</h3>
<p>If you're creating a hero for a game, see <a href="../secret-origins/index.html">Secret Origins</a> for a basic overview.
The following sections contain all the information you need to create your own hero. You may want to consult with your
Gamemaster before creating a hero to find out what sort of series your GM is interested in running, and what types of
heroes are appropriate.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-GAMEMASTERS">GAMEMASTERS</h3>
<p>If you plan to be a Gamemaster, you should familiarize yourself with this whole website. Start by looking over hero
creation in the <a href="../secret-origins/index.html">Secret Origins</a> section. Then read through the <a
href="../action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a> section, and familiarize yourself with how to do things in the
game. You may want to run a few sample combats using the sample archetypes, just to get a feel for things.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-UNDER-THE-HOOD">UNDER THE HOOD</h3>
<p>Throughout this website, you'll find various <b>Under the Hood</b> boxes. They take a look "behind the scenes" at the
logic underlying design decisions and rules, and offer advice on how to handle common problems or issues that might crop
up. They give you an inside look at how the game works and how to ensure you and your group get the most out of it.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-THE-CORE-MECHANIC">THE CORE MECHANIC</h2>
<p>This game uses a standard, or "core," game mechanic to resolve actions. Whenever a character attempts an action with
a chance of failure, do the following:</p>
<ol><li>Roll 3 Fudge dice (or 3dF).</li>
<li>Add any relevant modifiers (for game traits like abilities, skills, powers, or circumstances) to the sum rolled.</li>
<li>Compare the total to a number called a <b>difficulty class</b> (abbreviated <b>DC</b>).</li>
</ol>
<p>If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class (set by the GM based on the circumstances), the effort succeeds.
If the result is lower than the difficulty class, it fails.</p>
<p>This simple mechanic is used for nearly everything in the game, with variations based on what modifiers are made to
the roll, what determines the difficulty class, and the exact degree of success and failure.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Just remember...</p>
<div class="generated-class-64">3dF + modifiers vs. difficulty class</div>
<p style="text-align:center">...and you understand how to play most of the game!</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-THE-GAMEMASTER">THE GAMEMASTER</h2>
<p>One of the players in a game takes the role of <b>Gamemaster</b> (abbreviated <b>GM</b>). The Gamemaster is
responsible for running the game--a combination of writer, director, and referee. The GM creates the adventures for the
heroes, portrays the villains and supporting characters, describes the world to the players, and decides the outcome of
the heroes' actions based on the roll of the dice and the guidelines given in the rules. It's a big job, but also a
rewarding one, since the Gamemaster gets to develop the world and all the characters in it, along with inventing fun and
exciting stories.</p>
<p>If you're going to be the Gamemaster, you should read through this whole website carefully. You should have a firm
grasp of the rules, since you're expected to interpret them for the players to help decide what happens in the game.
You'll also help the players develop their own heroes, making sure they fit into the world and have potential for
exciting stories in their own right.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-THE-HEROES">THE HEROES</h2>
<p>The other players in a game create heroes, the main characters of their own adventures, like an ongoing comic book or
animated series. As a player, you create your hero following these guidelines and the guidance of your Gamemaster. There
are several components to creating a hero, described in detail in the linked pages, and outlined briefly below.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ABILITIES">ABILITIES</h3>
<p>All characters in this game, from heroes and villains to the average person on the street, are defined by eight
<b>abilities</b>, basic traits each character has to a greater or lesser extent. Abilities tell you how strong, smart,
and aware a character is, among other things. The abilities are: Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity, Fighting,
Intellect, Awareness, and Presence, described in detail on the <a href="../abilities.html">Abilities</a> page.</p>
<p>Each ability is assigned a <b>rank</b> from -5 to 20, measuring its effectiveness. A rank of 0 is unremarkable or
average, applying no modifier. Rank 1 is highly skilled or gifted. A 2 is one of the best in the world, while a 3 is about the
most that can be expected from a "normal" human being. Beyond that is superhuman, with a maximum rank of 20 (for power level 10).
Abilities can even have negative ranks, for those well below average, as low as -5.</p>
<p>For more about abilities, see the <a href="../abilities.html">Abilities</a> page.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-SKILLS">SKILLS</h3>
<p>Abilities describe a character's raw potential or overall capabilities. <a href="../skills.html">Skills</a> are a
refinement of those basic abilities into specific areas of endeavor. For example, Agility defines how quick and agile
your hero is, but the Acrobatics skill focuses on specific feats of agility like gymnastics, doing back flips, and so
forth. Think of abilities as providing a certain baseline, while skills focus in on a particular area of expertise.</p>
<p>Characters are said to have <b>training</b> in a skill if they have a rank in that skill. A character not trained in
a skill has no rank; only the character's basic ability applies to checks involving the skill. Trained characters have a
skill rank that adds to the basic ability when making checks. In the previous example, we said Acrobatics skill applies
to specific feats of agility. If, for example, a hero has Agility 6 and is trained in Acrobatics (with a rank of 7) then
the character's bonus for checks involving feats of agility covered by Acrobatics is 13 (6 plus 7). Obviously, training
in a skill makes characters more effective at checks involving that skill, often much more.</p>
<p>For details on what skills are available and what they do, see <a href="../skills.html">Skills</a>.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-ADVANTAGES">ADVANTAGES</h3>
<p>Halfway between skills and powers, <b>advantages</b> are minor benefits characters have, allowing them to do things
others cannot. They range from special combat maneuvers to things like financial resources, contacts, and so forth.</p>
<p>Many advantages have no rank, or rather just one rank; a character either has the advantage (and the benefits that it
grants) or does not. Other advantages may have multiple ranks, like abilities and skills, measuring their
effectiveness.</p>
<p>For details on the various advantages and what they provide, see <a href="../advantages.html">Advantages</a>.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-POWERS">POWERS</h3>
<p><b>Powers</b> are special abilities beyond those of ordinary human beings. They're like advantages, only much more
so. Whereas an advantage might give your hero an unusual ability, powers grant abilities that an average human will
never have (with a few exceptions).</p>
<p>Those abilities are based on <b>effects</b>, which describe what a power does in game terms. A power may have just
one effect or several, and you can apply various <b>modifiers</b> to the effects to change how they work, customizing
them to get just the right power.</p>
<p>Power effects have ranks like abilities and skills. Unlike abilities, effects do not have ranks of less than 1, since
the "average" (generally speaking) is not having powers at all!</p>
<p>Powers describe effects but not all of them are superhuman. For example <b>Movement: Swimming</b> at rank 2 (30 feet
in 6 seconds) could simply be the result of training whereas <b>Movement: Swimming</b> at rank 20 is an impossible speed
(that would be covering 4,000 miles every 6 seconds or 2 million miles per hour). <b>Teleport</b> on the other hand,
even at rank 1, cannot possibly be done by ordinary humans.</p>
<p>Some power effects require checks to use, while others operate automatically. For full descriptions of the various
effects powers can have, see <a href="../powers/index.html">Powers</a>.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-COMPLICATIONS">COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>Finally, heroes often have <b>complications</b> to overcome. Overcoming such challenges is part of what makes a real
hero. Complications range from physical disabilities or personal issues to unusual vulnerabilities. You choose your
hero's complications, defining some of the challenges your hero must overcome in the game. The process of dealing with
complications allows your character to be more heroic, discussed later in the rules.</p>
<p>See <a href="../secret-origins/index.html">Secret Origins</a> for more on complications.</p>
<div class="blue-box-header">GAME PLAY</div>
<p>A session of the this game resembles an issue of a comic book or an episode of an animated series. The Gamemaster and
the players get together and tell a story through the process of playing the game. The length of the game session can
vary, from just a couple hours to several hours or more. Some adventures may be completed in a single session while
others may take multiple sessions, just as some comic book stories are told in one issue while others span multiple
issues, forming a story arc or mini-series. The episodic nature of the game allows you to choose when to stop playing
and allows you to start up again at any time you and your friends want.</p>
<p>Also like a comic book, a game consists of a series of interrelated <b>scenes</b>. Some scenes are fairly
straightforward, with the heroes interacting with each other and the supporting cast. In these cases the GM generally
just asks the players to describe what their heroes are doing and in turn describes how the other characters react and
what they do. There may be some improvisational acting as everyone plays out the roles of their characters. When the
action starts happening, such as when the heroes are staving off a disaster or fighting villains, time becomes more
crucial and is broken down into <b>action rounds</b>, and the players generally have to make dice rolls to see how their
heroes do.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-CHECKS">CHECKS</h2>
<p>Your hero stands perched on the rooftop, looking down through the skylight. In the abandoned warehouse below, the
villain throws the switch that begins lowering your hero's friends into the vat of boiling acid! You turn to the
Gamemaster and say:</p>
<p><i>"I leap down, smashing through the skylight, swing over to the catwalk, kick the bad guy out of the way, then flip
the switch to stop the lowering mechanism!"</i></p>
<p><b>How exactly do you do that in the game?</b></p>
<p>Whenever a character in a game attempts something where the outcome is in doubt, it requires a <b>check</b> of an
appropriate trait: ability, skill, power, etc. (also known as a "trait check" or a "[fill-in trait name]" check, like a
"Dexterity check," for example).</p>
<p>Make a check by rolling the dice, adding the appropriate rank, and comparing the result against a <b>difficulty
class</b> (<b>DC</b>): if your result equals or exceeds the DC, you succeed. If it does not, then your attempt fails.
Sometimes how much you exceed or fail to exceed the DC matters, but often it is simply whether you do or not that
counts.</p>
<div class="generated-class-64">Check = 3dF + ability vs. difficulty class</div>
<p>So in the previous example, how many checks are there? Let's break things down and look at what the hero is
doing:</p>
<p><i>"...leap down ..."</i> Jumping down is literally as easy as falling off a log, so there's no need for a check
here.</p>
<p><i>"... smashing  through  the  skylight  ..."</i> Breaking something can require a check, but in this case--a body
hurling through Plexiglas--the Gamemaster does not see a point in making one, so this is automatic, too. This is one of
the ways the Gamemaster's judgment and intervention is important in the flow of the game.</p>
<p><i>"...swing over to the catwalk ..."</i> This part of the action is a bit of a judgment call. If your hero has the
Swinging movement effect (see <a href="../powers/index.html">Powers</a>), then this is automatic. Otherwise, it might call for
an Acrobatics skill check to pull it off; even then, if your hero is good enough at Acrobatics, the Gamemaster might
call this a routine check and waive the need for a roll (see <b>Routine Checks</b>).</p>
<p><i>"...kick the bad guy out of the way ..."</i> Here's the real crux of the hero's action. You want to hit the
villain who, naturally, wants to avoid being hit. This calls for a check of your hero's Fighting ability (which Measures
the ability to hit things close-up). If you decided to have your hero shoot or throw something at the villain that would
be a check of Dexterity instead.</p>
<p><i>"...flip the switch back up ..."</i> Assuming the bad guy is out of the way, this is easy, no check required. If
the hero's attempt to hit the villain fails, then the hero still has to get past him in order to do this at all. So it
all depends on the outcome of the Fighting check against the bad guy. If the mechanism was especially complex, the GM
might ask for a check here, such as using the Technology skill to figure out how it works.</p>
<p>As you can see, once you break it down, checks are actually fairly simple. All the Gamemaster has to say in response
to the player's declaration is: "Okay, roll a Fighting check to hit the villain," letting the rest of the description
stand as what happens. Whether or not the hero is successful in stopping the trap depends on the outcome of the attack
against the bad guy.</p>
<p>Of course, if the villain is expecting the hero, there might be another trap, such as part of the catwalk rigged to
fall away under him, leaving him dangling above the acid vat and at the villain's mercy! In that case, the GM would
respond to the player's description: "You smash through the skylight and swing over to the catwalk, but when you do..."
and go on to describe what follows. The rest of the hero's intended action(s) are null and void, because things don't
always go as planned when you're dealing with cunning supervillains!</p>
<p>Checks are used to resolve all outcomes so once you understand the basic concept, the rest is easy.</p>
<p>For detailed examples of how to use checks in the game and their effects, see <a
href="../action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-CRITICAL-SUCCESS-FAILURE">CRITICAL SUCCESS/FAILURE</h3>
<p>If you roll for any check and all 3 Fudge dice come up as +1 (for a total of +3 before modifiers), you've scored a
<b>critical success</b>. However if all 3 Fudge dice come up as -1 (for a total of -3 before modifiers) it is a <b>critical failure</b>.
The effect of a critical success or failure depends on the type of roll as shown in the table below. In most cases simply
add or subtract 1 from the result (-4 or +4 before the other modifiers).</p>
<table class="generated-class-2 alt grey-88-table-border">

<p>The effects of critical success/failure is based on real life: there is no such thing as an automatic success, however
mistakes can cause an automatic failure. A mistake can cause an automatic failure in the cases of an Attack, Active Defense,
or Ability/Skill. Passive Defense on the other hand functions independently of the character's consciousness and therefore
mistakes can't be made. The critical success of an attack is the black sheep by defying the mentioned logic
(I should look into another way of doing this: ie this is subject to change).</p>
<p>The reason Powers don't have automatic failure is a bit harder to explain. Basically the decision to use the power
is a conscious effort but the resulting effect is not and is a physics based reaction. For example a gun's attack can
automatically miss however if it does hit then the <b>Damage</b> will always be present (even if <b>Toughness</b> is
able to resist). Another example: using a <b>Move Object</b> power check to move an extra heavy object does not
have a chance to exert 0 force (although it might fail the check). Strength based powers are a gray zone so the Gamemaster
should decide how to handle a critical failure.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-DIFFICULTY-CLASS">DIFFICULTY CLASS</h3>
<p>Checks are made against a <b>difficulty class</b> or <b>DC</b>, a number set by the GM, which your check must equal
or exceed to achieve success. So for a task with a DC of 15 you must roll a check total (modifiers included) of 15 or greater to succeed. In
some cases, the results of a check vary based on how much higher or lower the result is than the DC, known as its
<b>degree</b> of success or failure.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-ROUTINE-CHECKS">ROUTINE CHECKS</h3>
<p>A check normally represents performing a task under a certain amount of pressure, in the midst of the furious action
of super-heroic adventure. When the situation is less demanding, you can achieve more reliable results.</p>
<p>Under routine circumstances--when you are not under any pressure--instead of rolling the dice for the check,
calculate your result as if you had rolled a 0. This ensures success for average (DC 0) tasks with a modifier of +0 or
more. More capable characters (with higher bonuses) can succeed on more difficult checks on a routine basis: a +6
bonus, for example, means a routine check can succeed at DC 6 tasks, and achieve
2 degrees of success on average (DC 0) tasks on a routine basis.</p>
<p>The GM decides when circumstances are suitable for performing a task as a routine check. Certain game traits also
change what tasks or situations are considered "routine" for a character. Routine checks help speed-up game play and
smooth-out some of the variability of dice rolling in situations where a character would be expected to perform at a
steady, reliable level. Routine checks are optional and a player may choose to roll the dice anyway in the event
degree of success matters.</p>
<p>If a character's routine check result is not up to a task, the player still has the option to roll the dice, since
the task is by definition not routine for that character. The idea behind routine checks is to eliminate dice-rolling
(and possible failures) for things competent characters should be able to accomplish on a regular basis, while still
having a good idea of the characters' capabilities.</p>

<div class="right-panel red-panel">
<div>Under the Hood: Using Opposed Checks</div>
<div>
<p>Opposed checks offer the Gamemaster a useful tool for comparing the efforts of two characters quickly and easily.
This applies not only to skills, but also powers and, in some cases, abilities. If two or more characters compete at a
particular task, you can resolve it with an opposed check. The character with the highest check result wins. Of course,
you can play things out if you want, but sometimes it's good to be able to resolve things with a quick opposed check and
move on.</p>
<p>As Gamemaster, if you find yourself without a particular rule to resolve a conflict or contest between characters,
the opposed check is your friend. Pick the appropriate skill, power, or ability, make checks for the characters and
compare the results to see how they did.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some checks are <b>opposed</b>. They are made against another character's check result as the DC. Whoever gets the
higher result wins. An example is trying to bluff someone. You roll a Deception check, while the GM rolls an Insight
check for your target. If you beat the target's Insight check result, you succeed.</p>
<p>For ties on opposed checks, the character with the higher bonus wins. If the bonuses are the same either resolve it
as a tie if possible or randomly determine the winner in some way such as flipping a coin or rolling a single Fudge die
having one character win on positive or heads, and the other character win on tails or negative (reroll 0); decide which
character is which before rolling.</p>

<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-ROUTINE-OPPOSITION">ROUTINE OPPOSITION</h3>
<p>In cases where two or more characters are actively opposing each other, both roll checks and compare the results. In
some situations, however, one or more of the characters in an opposed check may not even be aware of it! For example, a
guard standing watch and looking for intruders would make a Perception check to oppose any attempt at Stealth, but
somebody just sitting in a park, not expecting anyone to sneak up on her, isn't specifically looking. This is a case of
<b>routine opposition</b>, in which case the DC for the active character's check is the opposing character's modifier
+0, just like the result of a routine check (previously). Defenses are never routine: they are always rolled.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-COMPARISON-CHECKS">COMPARISON CHECKS</h3>
<p>In cases where a check is a simple test of one character's capability against another, with no luck involved, both
participants compare their appropriate ranks. The character with the higher rank wins. Just as you wouldn't roll a
"height check" to see who's taller, you don't need to make a Strength check to see who's stronger; Strength rank already
tells you that.</p>
<p>So when two characters arm wrestle, for example, the stronger character wins. If two flying characters race, the
faster character wins, and so forth. Note this does not include the use of extra effort (see <b>Extra Effort</b>) to
temporarily increase a character's rank, which can affect the outcome of a comparison check, nor does it include things
like maneuvers, tricks, or other ways of trying to affect the outcome. It assumes a straight-out comparison.</p>
<p>In the case of identical bonuses or ranks, each character has an equal chance of winning. Flip a coin or rolling a
single Fudge die just like a tied opposed check.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-GRADED-CHECKS">GRADED CHECKS</h3>
<p>Much of the time a check is a simple pass-fail, it either succeeds, or it does not. In other cases, it matters just
how well the check succeeded, or how badly it failed. This gradation of results is called a <b>graded check</b> and
involves a <b>degree</b> of success or failure.</p>
<p>Start by rolling normally then subtract the difference between the 2 results (take the absolute value so that the number
is always positive). Who wins the roll is determined in the same way (with a difference of 0 going to the defender).
The difference is divided by 3 rounded up except that a difference of 0 is considered 1 degree (instead of 0)
so 0-3 are 1 degree and 4-6 are 2 degrees. For example, a DC 10 check with a result of 13 is
one degree of success, just as a result of 8 is one degree of failure.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of degrees a check may have, although more than two degrees of failure rarely
matters, and some degrees of success may have no further effect beyond a certain point (once you have succeeded as well
as is possible in a given situation). For example, failure on an Acrobatics check to balance means you wobble and spend
that turn maintaining your balance, but don't move. Two degrees of failure mean you lose your balance and fall! After
that point, further degrees of failure don't really matter.</p>
<p>In cases where a single degree of success or failure is sufficient, the rules simply specify "success" or "failure"
without giving a degree (the degree doesn't even need to be determined).
Specific types of graded checks--notably skills checks and powers like
<a href="../powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>--give specific results for degrees of success
and failure in their descriptions.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-CIRCUMSTANCE-MODIFIERS">CIRCUMSTANCE MODIFIERS</h3>
<div class="right-panel blue-panel">
<div>Circumstances and Difficulty</div>
<div>
<p>Technically, circumstance modifiers could apply to either the check result of the difficulty class of a check,
affecting the character's performance, or making the task itself easier or harder. If you want to differentiate between
circumstance modifiers that affect performance versus those that modify the difficulty of a task, feel free to do so.
This game applies circumstance modifiers directly to the check result because it is easier to deal with them
consistently, and the game effect is the same: the chance of success changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some circumstances make checks easier or harder, resulting in a <b>bonus</b> or <b>penalty</b> to the check.
Characters in a favorable situation are said to <b>have a circumstance bonus</b> for the check, while those in a
disadvantageous situation are said to be <b>have a circumstance penalty</b>.</p>
<p>As a general rule, apply a modifier of plus or minus 1 if the character is at a bonus or penalty, and a
modifier of plus or minus 2 if the character is at a major bonus or major penalty for the check:</p>
<p class="generated-class-64">+/-1 for bonus/penalty</p>
<p class="generated-class-64">+/-2 for major bonus/penalty</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-TEAM-CHECKS">TEAM CHECKS</h3>
<div class="right-panel red-panel">
<div>Under the Hood: Circumstances</div>
<div>
<p>Circumstance modifiers are another useful Gamemaster tool for handling a lot of the variables that come up during
game play. Specific examples are discussed throughout the rules for various types of checks. One example includes the
following:</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-TOOLS">TOOLS</h3>
<p>Some tasks require tools. If tools are needed, the specific items are mentioned in the description of the task or
skill. If you don't have the appropriate tools, you may still be able to attempt the task, but at a major disadvantage,
for a -2 circumstance penalty on your check, if the GM decides you can attempt the task at all.</p>
<p>A character may be able to put together makeshift tools in order to make the check. If the GM allows this, reduce the
circumstance penalty to -1.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes characters work together and help each other out. In this case, one character (usually the one with the
highest bonus) is considered the leader of the effort and makes the check normally, while each helper makes the same
type of check using the same trait(s) against DC 0. The helpers' individual degrees of success (and failure!) are added
together to achieve the final outcome of the assistance. This can be done for attack checks in combat or each may attack
separately.</p>
<p>Success grants the leader a +1 circumstance bonus. Three or more total degrees of success grant a +2 circumstance
bonus. One degree of failure provides no modifier, but two or more impose a -1 circumstance penalty!</p>
<p>The GM sets the limit on how many characters can help as part of a team check. Regardless of the number of helpers,
the leader's bonus cannot be more than +2 (for three or more total degrees of success) nor the penalty greater than -1
(for two or more total degrees of failure).</p>
<p class="generated-class-64">Team Check = +1 circumstance bonus for one total degree of success</p>
<p class="generated-class-64">+2 circumstance bonus for three or more total degrees of success</p>
<p class="generated-class-64">-1 circumstance penalty for two or more total degrees of failure</p>
<br />
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-ATTACK-CHECKS">ATTACK CHECKS</h3>
<div>An <b>attack check</b> determines whether or not you hit an opponent in combat with an attack. It is a 3dF roll
plus your bonus with that particular attack, usually based off of Fighting or Dexterity and appropriate modifiers, like
the Close and Ranged Combat skills. The attack is an opposed check against your target's defense: Parry for close attacks,
Dodge for ranged attacks. If you equal or exceed your target's defense check result, your attack hits. Otherwise, you miss.</div>
<div class="generated-class-64">Attack Check = 3dF + attack bonus + other modifiers vs. resistance check (see below)</div>
<p>If all 3 Fudge dice come up as +1 (for a total of +3 before attack bonuses) for an attack check it always hits and
may be a <b>critical hit</b> (see <b>Critical Hits</b> in <a href="../action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>
for further information). But if all 3 Fudge dice come up as -1 (for a total of -3 before attack bonuses) on an attack
check it always misses, regardless of the check total.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-RESISTANCE-CHECKS">RESISTANCE CHECKS</h3>
<div>A <b>resistance check</b> is an attempt to resist different effects, ranging from damage and injury to traps, poisons,
and various power effects. A resistance check is a 3dF roll + the appropriate defense (typically Dodge, Fortitude, Toughness,
or Will).</div>
<div class="generated-class-64">Resistance Check = 3dF + defense bonus + other modifiers vs. hazard's DC (generally = rank)</div>
<p>The difficulty class is based on the strength of the hazard, such as the rank of an effect or the strength of a
disease or poison, typically equal to the that value (like a routine check). Resistance checks may be graded, with different
results at different degrees.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-THE-ACTION-ROUND">THE ACTION ROUND</h2>
<p>When things really start happening in a game, time is broken down into six-second segments called <b>rounds</b>
(sometimes "action rounds"). A round isn't very much time. Think of it like a page in a comic book, just long enough to
go around the table once, with each hero doing something. Each character's portion of the round is called their
<b>turn</b>.</p>
<p>The things you can do on your turn are broken up into <b>actions</b>. There are standard actions, move actions, free
actions, and reactions. During your turn you can take a standard and a move action (or 2 move actions instead)
along with as many free actions as you wish and as many reactions as are called for.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-STANDARD-ACTIONS">STANDARD ACTIONS</h3>
<p>A <b>standard action</b> generally involves acting upon something, whether it's an attack or using a power to affect
something. You're limited to one standard action each round.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-MOVE-ACTIONS">MOVE ACTIONS</h3>
<p>A <b>move action</b>, like the name implies, usually involves moving. You can take your move action before or after
your standard action, so you can attack then move, or move then attack. You cannot, however, normally split-up your move
action before and after your standard action. Move actions also include things like drawing weapons, standing up, and
picking up or manipulating objects.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-FREE-ACTIONS">FREE ACTIONS</h3>
<p>A <b>free action</b> is something so comparatively minor it doesn't take significant time, so you can perform as many
free actions in a round as the GM considers reasonable. Free actions include things like talking (heroes and villains
always find time to say a lot in the middle of a fight), dropping something, ending the use of a power, activating or
maintaining some other powers, and so forth.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-REACTIONS">REACTIONS</h3>
<p>A <b>reaction</b> is something you do (or that happens automatically) in response to something else. A reaction doesn't take any significant time,
like a free action. The difference is you react in response to something else happening during the round, perhaps not
even on your turn. Reactions don't count against your normal allotment of actions and you can react as often as the
circumstances dictate, but only when they dictate.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-EXTRA-EFFORT">EXTRA EFFORT</h2>
<p>Heroes are sometimes called upon to perform feats beyond even their amazing abilities. This calls for <b>extra
effort</b>. Players can use extra effort to improve a hero's abilities in exchange for the hero suffering some fatigue.
The benefits of extra effort are not limited by power level due to their extraordinary nature.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-USING-EXTRA-EFFORT">USING EXTRA EFFORT</h3>
<p>Players can have their heroes use extra effort simply by declaring they are doing so. Extra effort is a free action
and can be performed at any time during the hero's turn (but is limited to once per turn). Characters can't be compelled
or controlled to use extra effort or victory points. Resistance is the only extra effort you can use while being
Compelled or Controlled but the fatigue from the extra effort doesn't affect you until you're free of the effect; this
is so you can't resist yourself to exhaustion as a way of avoiding being controlled! If you are Compelled or Controlled
and you are exhausted then you can't use extra effort. If you are Compelled or Controlled and you would be exhausted
upon regaining control then you can't use extra effort. If you are not Compelled or Controlled and you are exhausted
then extra effort may still be used but doing so incapacitates you. A hero using extra effort gains one of the following
benefits:</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-ACTION">ACTION</h3>
<p>Gain an additional standard action during your turn, which can be exchanged for a move or free action, as usual.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-BONUS">BONUS</h3>
<p>Perform one check with a +1 circumstance bonus. This only applies to skill or defense checks and not power
checks for that see <a href="#TOC-INCREASED-RANK">Increased Rank</a> below. This circumstance bonus bonus stacks with
any other circumstance penalty (effectively negating a -1 penalty) or bonus with a maximum of +2.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-INCREASED-RANK">INCREASED RANK</h3>
<p>Increase one of your hero's power effects by +1 rank for 1 round. Permanent effects
cannot be increased in this way.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-POWER-STUNT">POWER STUNT</h3>
<p>Temporarily gain and use another power. This temporary power lasts until the end of the scene or until its duration
expires, whichever comes first. Fatigue sets in right after the effect expires. The temporary power can't have permanent
duration although the Gamemaster may permit permanent duration powers to be used as a base for a temporary power. When
performing a power stunt you may choose a power you have, you then gain a temporary power of your choice as long as it
is explainable how it is related to the original power. The temporary power can have a max cost of 10 points higher than
the original power.</p>
<p>If no original power was chosen then no relation needs to exist but the temporary power only has 10
points to distribute. The temporary power may be the same as the original in order to have different modifiers or
descriptors. Remember that power stunts should never ruin the fun: try to avoid a
dues ex machina style power that you got just because it would be convenient to get around a plot point.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-RESISTANCE">RESISTANCE</h3>
<p>Gain an immediate additional resistance check against an ongoing effect. This is the only extra effort that can be
used while being compelled or controlled.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-RETRY">RETRY</h3>
<p>Certain effects (see the <a href="../powers/index.html">Powers</a>) require extra effort to retry after a certain degree of
failure. The extra effort merely permits another attempt to use the effect; it grants no other benefits.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-SPEED">SPEED</h3>
<p>Increase the hero's speed rank by +1 for 1 round. If that form of movement doesn't have
permanent duration then this is the same as <a href="#TOC-INCREASED-RANK">Increased Rank</a> above.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-STRENGTH">STRENGTH</h3>
<p>Increase the hero's Strength rank by +1 for 1 round.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-COST-OF-EXTRA-EFFORT">COST OF EXTRA EFFORT</h3>
<p>At the start of the turn immediately after using extra effort, the hero becomes fatigued. A fatigued hero who uses
extra effort becomes exhausted and an exhausted hero who uses extra effort is asleep and can't be woken up until
exhausted is removed either by healing or 1 hour of sleep, after either case the hero is still asleep but can now be
woken up (combat generally causes enough noise to wake someone). If you spend a victory point at the start of your turn
following the extra effort to remove the fatigue, the hero suffers no adverse effects. In essence, spending a victory point
lets you use extra effort without suffering fatigue but you must be fatigued at least until your next turn.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-VICTORY-POINTS">VICTORY POINTS</h2>
<p>Whether it's luck, talent, or sheer determination, heroes have something setting them apart from everyone else,
allowing them to perform amazing feats under the most difficult circumstances. In Humans &amp; Heroes that
"something" is Victory points. Spending a Victory point can make the difference between success and failure in the game.
When you're entrusted with the safety of the world, that means a lot!</p>
<p>Victory points allow players to "edit" the plot of the adventure and the rules of the game to a degree. They give
heroes the ability to do the amazing things heroes do in the comics, but with certain limits, and they encourage players
to make the sort of choices heroes do in the comics, in order to get more Victory points.</p>
<p>Players start each in game day with 2 Victory points. During the adventure they get opportunities to earn more
Victory points. Players can use various tokens (poker chips, glass beads, etc.) to keep track of their Victory points,
handing them over to the Gamemaster when they spend them. The Gamemaster can likewise give out tokens when awarding
Victory points to the players.</p>
<p>Unspent Victory points don't carry over to the next adventure; the heroes start out with 2 points again. Use them or
lose them! Since Victory points are a finite resource, players need to manage them carefully, spending them at the most
opportune times and taking chances to earn them through complications. Playing it "safe" tends to eliminate chances of
getting more Victory points while taking risks, facing complications, and, in general, acting like a hero offers rewards
that help them out later on.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-USING-VICTORY-POINTS">USING VICTORY POINTS</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, spending a Victory point is a reaction, taking no time, and you can spend as many Victory
points as you have. Characters can't be compelled or controlled to use extra effort or victory points. You can spend
Victory points for any of the following:</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-EDIT-SCENE">EDIT SCENE</h3>
<p>You can "edit" a scene to grant your hero an advantage by adding or changing certain details. For example, a hero is
fighting a villain with plant-based powers in a scientific lab. You deduce the villain may be weakened by defoliants, so
you ask the GM if there are any chemicals in the lab you can throw together to create a defoliant. The Gamemaster
requires a Victory point to add that detail and says the right chemicals are close at hand. Now you just have to use
them!</p>
<p>How much players are allowed to "edit" circumstances is up to the individual Gamemaster, but generally Victory points
should not be allowed to change any event that has already occurred or any detail already explained in-game. For
example, players cannot "edit" away damage or the effects of powers (Victory points already allow this to a limited
degree, see the following). The GM may also veto uses of editing that ruin the adventure or make things too easy on the
players. This option is intended to give the players more input into the story and allow their heroes chances to
succeed, but it shouldn't be used as a replacement for planning and cleverness, just a way to enhance them.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-HEROIC-FEAT">HEROIC FEAT</h3>
<p>You can spend a Victory point to gain the benefits of one rank of an advantage you don't already have until the end
of your next turn (see <a href="../advantages.html">Advantages</a>). You must be capable of using the advantage and cannot gain the benefits
of fortune advantages, only other types. If the advantage has any prerequisites, you must have them to gain the benefits
of the advantage as a heroic feat.</p>
<p>You can spend a Victory point to be able to make a skill check untrained even though the skill can't normally be
performed untrained such as Treatment. This is the same thing as gaining the Advantage <b>Jack of All Trades</b> for a
single check.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-IMPROVE-ROLL">IMPROVE ROLL</h3>
<p>One Victory point allows you to re-roll any dice roll you make and take the better of the two rolls.
You must spend the Victory point to improve a roll before the GM announces the outcome of your initial roll. You
cannot spend Victory points on dice rolls made by the GM or other players without the
<a href="../powers/effects/luck-control-control.html">Luck Control</a> power.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-INSPIRATION">INSPIRATION</h3>
<p>You can spend a Victory point to get sudden inspiration in the form of a hint, clue, or bit of help from the GM. It
might be a way out of the villain's fiendish deathtrap, a vital clue for solving a mystery, or an idea about the
villain's weakness. It's up to the GM exactly how much help the players get from inspiration and how it manifests, but
since Victory points are a very limited resource, the help should be in some way significant.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-INSTANT-COUNTER">INSTANT COUNTER</h3>
<p>You can spend a Victory point to attempt to counter an effect used against you as a reaction. See
<a href="../powers/effects/index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">Countering Effects</a> for details.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin" id="TOC-NEGATE-COMPLICATION">NEGATE COMPLICATION</h3>
<p>You can spend one of your victory point to negate a Gamemaster-imposed complication (at the GM's discretion).
This also eliminates the complication, however, so no victory points are awarded for it. If a victory point has already been
awarded then it must also be spent (for a total cost of 2 victory points). The victory point can be spent to prevent

<p>You can spend a Victory point to recover faster. A Victory point allows you to immediately remove a dazed, fatigued,
or stunned condition, without taking an action. Among other things, this option allows you to use extra effort
(previously) without suffering any fatigue. Spending a Victory point to recover also lets you convert the asleep
condition into exhausted and exhausted into a fatigued condition.</p>

<p>In comic book stories, heroes often confront the villain(s) and deal with various setbacks. Perhaps the villain
defeats or outwits them in the first couple scenes. Maybe one or more of the heroes have to overcome a personal problem.
The villain may have a secret the heroes need to discover, and so forth. By the end of the story, the heroes have
overcome these challenges and they're ready to take on the villain. Humans &amp; Heroes reflects this kind of
story structure through the awarding of Victory points. The heroes gain additional Victory points as an adventure
progresses. When the going gets tough, the heroes get tougher, because they get Victory points to help them overcome
future challenges. Heroes get Victory points from complications, acts of heroism, roleplaying, and being generally
entertaining (this is a comic book after all). See <a href="../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">Complications</a> for details.</p>
