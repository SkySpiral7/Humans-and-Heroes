<p>This game uses the term <b>rank</b> when talking about the value of a game trait. So you might say a hero has "rank 8
Strength" or simply "Strength 8" (which mean the same thing), or that an effect is rank 5, 9, 15, or what have you.
Every quantifiable trait in the game has a rank assigned to it.</p>
<p>The game also uses a system of <b>measures</b>, real world values like pounds, seconds, minutes, hours, feet, yards,
and miles, to name a few. There is a direct relationship between rank and measure, as shown on the <b>Measurements
Table</b>.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-USING-THE-MEASUREMENTS-TABLE">USING THE MEASUREMENTS TABLE</h3>
<div class="right-panel green-panel">
<div>Things to Know About Measurements</div>
<div>
<p>When using the Measurements Table, there are a few important things to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Each rank represents a range of measures</b>. Time rank 4 is actually all measures between 0.8 and 1.6 minutes, and
time rank 16 is everything between 2.3 and 4.6 days! So if you're looking for a measurement that's not on the table, pick
the next highest one that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than 6.8 hours, but less than 14), and 6 miles is a
distance rank of 11 (more than 5.8 miles, but less than 12).</p>
<p><b>Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks</b>. In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed 14 hero
to cover 30 miles is rank -1, or 3 seconds. You can extend the negative side the Measurement Table just like you can the
positive side, with each lower rank halving the previous measurement. So rank -6 is 0.75 pounds, 1/8th of a second,
and 5.6 inches, for example.</p>
<p><b>Don't directly add ranks</b>. Putting rank 4 distance together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance! Rank
4 is a distance measurement of 480 feet. Rank 6 is 1,900 feet. Adding the measurements, you get about 2,400
feet. 2,400 feet is distance rank 7 but rank 10 distance is 4 miles! If you have different ranks, it is best
to either handle them separately or convert them to measurements, add the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank.</p>
<p><b>Measurements are approximate</b>. Especially at the higher end, where each rank represents a wide range of
measurements, the Measurements Table isn't intended to provide precise values; it's just a ballpark estimate so you have
an idea of how things work in the context of the game. Don't focus too heavily on precise answers, just use the table
for general guidelines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The relationship between rank and measure has a number of uses in this game.</p>
<p>First, the capabilities of many traits are translated from their rank into a measurement. So the amount of weight a
Strength rank of 3 can lift is determined by finding the equivalent weight measurement on the table, or 400 lbs.
Similarly, the mass, distance, or time affected by various other traits, especially powers, is determined on the
Measurements Table.</p>
<p>Also, because the measurements on the table operate at the same scale (roughly doubling every rank), it is possible
to use it to quickly figure out relationships between things like mass, distance, speed, and time:</p>
<p class="generated-class-5">Distance Rank = Time Rank + Speed Rank</p>
<p>To determine the distance a hero covers in a given amount of time, add the rank of the time to the rank of the hero's
speed, with normal human ground speed being rank 0. So a normal person can cover 2 miles in an hour (time 9 + speed 0 =
9, the rank for 2 miles). In fact, with normal human speeds, you can just directly compare the time and distance columns
of the table! As another example, a hero with Flight 12 can cover 8,000 miles in an hour! That's 12 (speed) + 9 (time) =
21, the rank for 8,000 miles. The same character can go an amazing 16 miles in just 6 seconds (the time of one action
round)!</p>
<p class="generated-class-5">Time Rank = Distance Rank - Speed Rank</p>
<p>Reversing the previous formula, we can also figure out how long it takes someone at a particular speed to cover a
given distance, by subtracting the speed rank from the distance rank to get a time rank. So a normal human (speed 0)
walking 30 miles (distance 13) takes about 16 hours. A hero with Speed 14 covers the same distance in (13 - 14 = -1)
just 3 seconds!</p>
<p class="generated-class-5">Throwing Distance Rank = Strength Rank - Mass Rank</p>
<p>As another example, the distance rank a hero can throw something equals the hero's Strength rank minus the mass rank
of the object. So a hero with Strength 10 (able to lift 25 tons), picks up a 10-ton truck (mass rank 8). Since 10 - 8 =
2, the hero can then toss the truck rank 2 distance (120 feet)!</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-UNITS-AND-ACCURACY">UNITS AND ACCURACY</h3>
<p>The first table below uses United States customary units and the one below that uses the Metric system. <strong>
WARNING: the two tables are incompatible.</strong> All positive and negative ranks are based on rank 0 values and usually
have 2 significant digits. But as described in the side bar above they are not supposed to be accurate. They are designed
to be convenient and to counteract the law of diminishing return.</p>
