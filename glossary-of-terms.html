<div class="page-header-red">GLOSSARY OF TERMS</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<div style="padding:5px 0px">Following are a collection of important terms used throughout this game. The definitions of these terms are taken from the text found earlier in this book. For the clearest explanation of what each term means it may be best refer to the complete text in which the term was introduced.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px">Conditions are listed here only for quick reference for a full description see <a href="home/conditions.html">Conditions</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>3dF</b>: Short hand for 3 Fudge dice.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>ability rank</b>: The numerical rating of an ability, from -5 to 20 or more, with an average of 0.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>ability</b>: One of eight basic character traits: Strength (Str), Stamina (Sta), Dexterity (Dex), Agility (Agl), Fighting (Fgt), Intellect (Int), Awareness (Awe), and Presence (Pre).</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>absent</b>: Entirely lacking a particular ability. Absent abilities impose specific penalties greater than just a low (negative) rank in an ability. For example, absent Strength indicates a character unable to exert any physical force.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>accurate sense</b>: A sense you can use to pinpoint something's location precisely enough to target it in combat. Vision is the only natural accurate sense for humans. Other accurate senses are available from the Senses effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>accurately perceive (also accurately sense)</b>: To perceive something with an accurate sense.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>action</b>: A character activity. There are standard, move, and free actions and you can trade a "higher" type of action for a "lower" type, such as a standard for a move action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>acute sense</b>: A sense able to discern fine details about a subject. Human visual and auditory senses are normally acute.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>advantage</b>: A character trait involving a specific benefit or enhancement. Some advantages allow characters to overcome certain limitations (changing how certain maneuvers work, for example) while others add a new capability.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>adventure</b>: A story for players to experience, like a single issue of a comic book. The story may have multiple parts (or issues) but is generally only one plot. This is an arbitrary unit of time determined by the Gamemaster.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>alternate effect</b>: One power or effect that may be substituted for another, but not usable at the same time, giving a power different options or "settings."</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>archetype</b>: A pregenerated character representing a particular type commonly seen in comic book stories.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>array</b>: A collection of alternate effects making up a single power.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>asleep</b>: A combined condition. While asleep, a character is defenseless, stunned, and unaware. A hearing Perception check with three or more degrees of success wakes the character and removes all these conditions, as does any sudden movement (such as shaking the sleeping character) or any effect allowing a resistance check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>at will</b>: It means "as a free action".</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>attack bonus</b>: The total modifier applied to an attack check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>attack check</b>: A check to determine if an attack hits. To make an attack check, roll 3dF and add the appropriate modifiers for the attack type. An attack hits if the check result is equal to or greater than the target's appropriate defense. A natural 20 on an attack check always hits, while a natural 1 always misses.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>attack</b>: Any of numerous actions intended to harm, disable, or neutralize an opponent. An attack is usually a standard action and involves a check versus a target's defense.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>blind</b>: A combined condition. The character cannot see, so everything effectively has full visual concealment from him. He is hindered, visually unaware, and vulnerable, and may be impaired or disabled for activities where vision is a factor.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>bonus</b>: A positive modifier to a dice roll.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>bound</b>: A combined condition. A bound character is defenseless, immobile, and impaired.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>character(s)</b>: A fictional individual in the game. The players control player characters, while the Gamemaster controls all non-player characters (NPCs), including adversaries and supporting cast.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>check(s)</b>: A method of deciding the outcome of an action. Checks are based on a relevant character ability, skill, power, or other trait. To make a check, roll 3dF and add any relevant modifiers to get a check result. If the check result equals or exceeds the difficulty class of a task or the result of an opponent's check, it succeeds. If it does not, it fails.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>character points</b>: Points allocated to a character's different traits during character creation, also awarded for advancement.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>circumstance modifier</b>: A modifier that reflects circumstances making the check easier (a circumstance bonus) or harder (a circumstance penalty). Circumstance modifiers are +/-2 (for a bonus or penalty) and +/-5 (for a major bonus or penalty).</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>close attack</b>: An attack used in close (hand-to-hand or melee) combat.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>combined condition</b>: a set of basic conditions tied to a common descriptor. They're essentially a kind of "short-hand" for talking about a group of basic conditions that go together in a particular circumstance.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>comparison check(s)</b>: A comparison of the trait ranks of two characters to determine which is higher. The character with the higher rank wins the check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>compelled</b>: A condition. A compelled character is directed by an outside force, but struggling against it; the character is limited to free actions and a single standard action per turn, with both types of action being chosen by another, controlling character. As usual, this standard action can be traded for a move action. Controlled supersedes compelled.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>complication</b>: A story or background element about a character that poses difficulties. Players are awarded hero points for roleplaying and dealing with characters' complications.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>concealment</b>: Conditions making someone or something difficult to perceive, and therefore aim at. Concealment imposes a circumstance penalty on attack checks: -2 for partial concealment and -5 for total concealment.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>condition</b>: A game term describing a character's overall health and state of being.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>construct</b>: A non-living being, having an absent Stamina, but still possessing other abilities. Constructs including things like robots and the undead.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>controlled</b>: A condition. A controlled character has no free will; the character's actions each turn are dictated by another, controlling, character.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>countering</b>: The use of one effect to block or eliminate another, requiring an opposed power check between the two effects. Countering normally requires a readied action, unless using a hero point to counter immediately as a reaction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>critical hit (also crit)</b>: An especially successful attack inflicting additional damage. To score a critical hit, an attacker must get a critical success on an attack check and the attack total must equal or exceed the target's defense check. A critical hit does +5 damage over the attack's normal damage, or you may add an effect, or use an alternate effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>critical success</b>: An especially successful use of a skill which grants a +5 bonus. When making a check if all 3 Fudge dice coming up as +1 (for a total of +3 before attack bonuses) then it is a critical success. Add 5 to the sum.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>damage bonus</b>: A modifier used to determine the damage of an attack.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>damage</b>: An effect that causes a character harm. Damage is resisted by Toughness.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>damage condition</b>: A condition imposed by a damage effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>dazed</b>: A condition. A dazed character is limited to free actions and a single standard action per round, although the character may use that action to perform a move, as usual. Stunned supersedes dazed.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0px"><b>deaf</b>: A combined condition. The character cannot hear, giving everything total auditory concealment from him. This may allow for surprise attacks on the unaware character (see <b>Surprise Attack</b> in the <a href="8-action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>). Interaction with other characters is limited to sign-language and lip-reading. (See <b>Interaction Skills</b>.)</div>
