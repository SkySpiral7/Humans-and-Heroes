<div style="font-size:16px">
<div style="padding:5px">Modifiers change how an effect works, making it more effective (an <b>extra</b>) or less
effective (a <b>flaw</b>). Modifiers have ranks, just like other traits. Extras increase a power's cost while flaws
decrease it. Unless its description specifies otherwise, a modifier is a permanent
change in how the effect works. That is, you do not have the option of
using the modifier or not, it always applies. Some modifiers increase an effect's cost per rank, others apply an unchanging cost to the power's total; these are called <b>flat modifiers</b>. For different versions of an effect with different modifiers--such as a
regular Damage effect and one with the Area modifier--see the <b>Alternate
Effect</b> modifier.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The final cost of a power is determined by base effect costs, modified by extras and flaws,
multiplied by the power's rank, with flat modifiers applied to the total cost.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;text-align:center;font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:rgb(153,0,0)">Power Cost = ((base effect costs + extras - flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px"><a name="TOC-APPLYING-MODIFIERS"></a>APPLYING MODIFIERS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">An extra increases an effect's cost per rank by a set amount (usually 1 point) while a flaw
decreases the effect's cost per rank by a set amount (usually 1 point as well). To determine the effect's final cost per
rank, take the base cost, add up all the extras, and subtract all of the flaws.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;text-align:center;font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:rgb(153,0,0)">Modified Cost = base effect cost + extras - flaws</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FRACTIONAL-COSTS"></a>FRACTIONAL COSTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If total flaws reduce an effect's cost per rank to less than 1 character point, each additional
-1 to cost per rank beyond that adds to the number of ranks of the effect you get by spending 1 character point on a
1-to-1 basis.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">In essence, an effect's cost can be expressed as the ratio of character points per rank (PP:R).
So an effect costing 3 points per rank is 3:1. If that effect has a total of -2 in modifiers, it costs 1:1, or 1
character point per rank. Applying another -1 modifier adds to the second part of the ratio, making it 1:2, or 1
character point per two ranks, and so forth.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Continue the progression for further reductions. Gamemasters may wish to limit the final
modified cost ratio of any effect in the series (to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, or whatever figure is appropriate). As a general
rule, 1:5 (five ranks per character point) should be the lowest modified cost for an effect, but the GM sets the limit
(if any).</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A hero has Protection, which costs 1 point per rank. Protection has two modifiers; the first is the Imperious extra (a +1 point per rank modifier), and the second is the flaw Limited to Blunt Physical Attacks (a -3 points per rank modifier) for a total modifier of -2. Since Protection costs 1 point per rank, the -2 modifier increases the number of ranks per character point, so the final cost is 1 character point per 3 ranks of Impervious Protection Limited to Blunt physical Attacks.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-PARTIAL-MODIFIERS"></a>PARTIAL MODIFIERS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can apply a modifier to only some of an effect's ranks and not others to fine-tune the
effect. A modifier must apply to at least one rank, and may apply to as many ranks as the effect has. The change in cost
and effect applies only to the ranks with the modifier; the unmodified ranks have their normal cost and effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Marksman's micro-rockets are a Damage 7 effect. They also explode on impact, for a Burst Area Damage effect, but the Area Damage is only rank 4. So the first 4 ranks of the Marksman's Damage effect have the Burst Area modifier, costing 1 point more (or 3 per rank). The remaining 3 ranks have their usual cost (2 per rank). Marksman makes a normal ranged attack check against the main target for his micro-rocket launcher; if he hits, the target has to resist Damage 7, and everyone within the area around the target resists Damage 4 (the Area Damage). Even if he misses, the main target has to resist the Area Damage 4, since the micro-rocket explodes close by! In Marksman's business, it pays to cover your bases...</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FLAT-VALUE-MODIFIERS"></a>FLAT-VALUE MODIFIERS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Some modifiers, rather than increasing or decreasing an effect's cost per rank, have a flat
value in character points, noted as <b>flat</b> in the modifier's header. For example, the Subtle extra costs only 1 or
2 points, depending on how subtle the effect is. Likewise, the Activation flaw has a flat value of -1 or -2 points,
depending on how long the power takes to activate.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Flat-value modifiers are applied to the final cost of an effect, after its cost per rank and
total cost for its number of ranks is determined. So, for example, if an effect costs 2 points per rank, with +1 per
rank for extras and -2 per rank for flaws. It has a final adjusted cost of (2 + 1 - 2) or 1 point per rank. With 8
ranks, it costs 8 character points. If the same effect also has a flat-value extra costing 2 points and a flat-value
flaw worth -1 point, then you add 2 to the final cost and subtract 1, for a total of (8 points for the effect + 2 points
for the flat extra - 1 point for the flat flaw) or 9 character points. modified cost + flat extra value - flat flaw
value</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A flat-value flaw cannot reduce an effect or power's final cost below 1 character point.</div>

<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this extra is especially accurate; you get +2 per Accurate rank to attack checks
made with it. The power level limits maximum attack bonus with any given effect.</div>

<div style="padding:5px">An incorporeal being can use an effect with this extra on the corporeal world (see the <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/insubstantial-general.html">Insubstantial</a> effect description). When an effect is
used against a corporeal target, the effect's rank is equal to the rank of this extra, up to a maximum of the effect's
full rank. Characters with lower ranks 1-3 of Insubstantial do not require this extra for their effects to work on the
physical world, although they can apply it to their Strength rank to allow them to exert some Strength while
Insubstantial.
This modifier could instead be listed on the Insubstantial page since that power is required for this modifier to do anything but this isn't a unique modifier since it is applied to any power.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-AFFECTS-OBJECTS"></a>AFFECTS OBJECTS +0 OR +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier allows effects normally resisted by Fortitude to work on non-living objects
(those with no Stamina). Generally, this extra applies to effects like Heal or Weaken, allowing them to work on objects
in the same way as they do living creatures. If the effect <b>Affects Only Objects</b>, working on objects but not on
living creatures, it has a net modifier of +0. If the effect works on both living creatures and objects then this
modifier costs +1 cost per rank.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Objects do not get resistance checks; the effect works on the targeted object at its maximum
degree of success. At the GM's discretion, someone holding, carrying, or wearing an object can make a Dodge resistance
check against the effect, representing pulling the object out of the way at the last moment.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-AFFECTS-OTHERS"></a>AFFECTS OTHERS +0 OR +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This extra allows you to give someone else use of a personal effect. You must touch the subject
as a standard action, and they have control over their use of the effect, although you can withdraw it when you wish as
a free action. They may also dismiss it as a free action. If you are unable to maintain the effect, it stops working,
even if someone else is using it. You may only use the power yourself if no one else is using it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A target can only have a 1 affect others being applied to you at a time (excluding ones you
own) this means only a single linked group of powers or a single device worth at most.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a device is using this modifier to grant the user a power that has duration shorter than
continuous then the device must be in use whenever the effect is maintained otherwise the duration ends. A device that
uses a continuous effect will not end until the current user decides to end the duration, destoring the device will not
end the duration (the duration will continue until the device is fixed or the effect is countered).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you can never use the effect (<b>Affects Only Others</b> is has a built in flaw) it has a
net modifier of +0. Otherwise this modifier costs +1 cost per rank.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-ALTERNATE-RESISTANCE"></a>ALTERNATE RESISTANCE +0 OR +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this modifier has a different resistance than usual. The resistance check
difficulty class remains the same, only the resistance differs. If the change is to a generally lower (and therefore
more advantageous) resistance, this extra increases cost per rank by +1. If, in the GM's opinion, there is no real
increase in effectiveness, just a chance to the resistance, it has a net modifier of +0. Generally changing from
Toughness to any other defense is +1 although this modifier is never a flaw even if changing from any defense to
Toughness. The defense against an attack can't be changed, it is determined by range: Parry for Close range and Dodge
for Ranged range. To add a resistance check for Perception range see the <b>Resistible</b> flaw below.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-AREA"></a>AREA +1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This extra allows an effect that normally works on a single target to affect an area. This
modifier can't be applied to Enhanced Trait or powers with the Affects Others modifier, however the Attack modifier has
no conflict due to the effect acting as one. In order to get Enhanced Trait or powers with the Affects Others to affect
multiple targets see the Split modifier. No attack check is needed; the effect simply fills the designated area, based
on the type of modifier. Potential targets in the area are permitted a Dodge resistance check (DC 10 + effect rank) to
avoid some of the effect (reflecting ducking for cover, dodging out of the way, and so forth). Partial cover reduces the
Area effect to half its normal rank against that target (round down, minimum of 1 rank) and total cover makes the target
immune entirely each assuming that the area effect doesn't ignore cover like Cloud shape normally does and can't simply
destroy the cover during the attack. If the target can't reach cover or leave the area within 1 second (speed - 2) then
the dodge check fails. Dodge check is used as reflexes to test reaction time but speed is still needed to be able to get
to safety (Immobile characters can't get to safety). If the target already has total cover when the area effect is used
then that target is automatically immune if possible. If Permeate or Insubstantial has at least reaction activation then
it can be used to provide cover by going inside of objects or simply being immune to damage. If the target is unaware of
the effect they can't dodge. An Area must have a Shape (see below) and interacts with different ranges (see Range
below). Cone and Line shapes are the only 2 that allow the Indirect modifier.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-AREA-SHAPE"></a>SHAPE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Choose one of the following options:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Burst</b>: The effect fills a sphere with a 30-foot radius (distance rank 0). Bursts on
level surfaces (like the ground) create hemispheres 30 feet in radius and height.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Cloud</b>: The effect fills a sphere with a 15-foot radius (distance rank -1) that lingers
in that area for one round after its duration expires (affecting any targets in the area normally during the additional
round). Clouds on level surfaces (like the ground) create hemispheres 15 feet in radius and height. If the effect
depends on inhalation holding your breath will provide immunity (constructs must breath by default unless it has
immunity to suffocation). This area can be used in any environment: indoors, in space, underwater and otherwise. But it
is always weather dependant meaning that wind (or an ocean current etc) will counter the effect. Cloud shaped area
effects can reach around corners (in within range) and will permeat as gas (or water when underwater) therefore for
cover to be effective it must be at least water-tight.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Cone</b>: The effect fills a cone with a length, width, and height of 30 feet (distance rank
0), spreading out from the effect's starting point. Cones on a level surface halve their final height unless the effect
is aimed upward so that the bottom of the cone is hitting the main target.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Cylinder</b>: The effect fills a cylinder 30 feet in radius and height (distance rank
0).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Line</b>: The effect fills a path 5 feet wide and 60 feet long (distance rank 1) in a
straight line.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Perception</b>: The effect works on anyone able to perceive the target point with a
particular sense, chosen when you apply this extra, like a Sense-Dependent effect (see the <b>Sense-Dependent</b>
modifier). Targets get a Dodge resistance check, as usual, but if the check is successful suffer no effect (rather than
half). Concealment that prevents a target from perceiving the effect also blocks it. This modifier includes the
Sense-Dependent flaw (see <b>Flaws</b>) so it cannot be applied again. If it is applied to an already Sense-Dependent
effect, it costs 2 points per rank rather than 1.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Shapeable</b>: The effect fills a volume of 500 cubic feet (volume rank 9), and you may
shape the volume as you wish, so long as it all remains contiguous and it must be at least 5 feet in each dimension. A 5
foot cube is 125 cubic feet which means that 500 cubic feet is 4 cubes.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Each +1 point increase in cost per rank moves the area's distance rank up by 1. So a Burst Area
with +2 cost per rank has a 60-foot radius (distance rank 1), a 120-foot radius at +3 cost per rank (distance rank 2),
and so forth.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-AREA-RANGE"></a>RANGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The Area modifier interacts with different ranges as follows:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Close</b>: An effect must be at least close range in order to apply Area (personal range
effects work only on the user by definition). A Close Area effect originates from the user and expands to fill the
affected area; the user is not affected by it. So, for example, Close Burst Area Damage does not damage the user, who is
at the center of the burst. This immunity does not apply to other effects, nor does it extend to anyone else: for that,
apply the Selective extra. If the user wants to be affected at the same time, increase cost per rank by +1 once. An
example would be a Close Burst Area Healing effect that included the user along with everyone else in the area. This is
the equivalent of the +1 Affects Others modifier.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Ranged</b>: A ranged area effect can be placed anywhere within the effect's range, extending
to fill the area's volume from the origin point. This includes a free Indirect 1 (see <b>Indirect</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Perception</b>: A perception area effect can be placed anywhere the user can accurately
perceive. Perception area effects neither require an attack check nor allow a Dodge resistance check, although targets
still get a normal resistance check against the effect. perception area effects are blocked by either concealment or
cover; choose one when acquiring the effect. For concealment, if the attacker can't accurately perceive a target in the
area, it is unaffected. Thus even heavy smoke or darkness can block the effect. Effects blocked by cover are much like
conventional area effects: solid barriers interfere with the effect, even if they are transparent, but the effect
ignores concealment like darkness, shadows, or smoke. Only targets behind total cover are unaffected.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mindmaster has a Burst Area Affliction, allowing him to seize control of the minds of everyone in the affected area. He must be able to accurately perceive a target to control it; an invisible foe or one out of his line of sight, for example, would be unaffected, even if they were within the area of the burst. On the other hand, targets behind a glass wall or invisible force field are affected, since Mindmaster can perceive them. Conversely, Fright-Master has a Burst Area Affliction as well--his fear-inducing gas. Targets behind a solid barrier (such as on the other side of that glass wall or invisible shield) are unaffected, but the unseen or concealed target is, even though Fright-Master can't perceive him, since the gas still reaches them.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-ATTACK"></a>ATTACK +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This extra applies to personal range effects, making them into attack effects. Examples include
Shrinking and Teleport, causing a target to shrink or teleport away, respectively. Unlike most extras, the effect's cost
does not change, although it does work differently.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The effect no longer works on you (so a Teleport Attack can't be used to teleport yourself, for
example). It affects one creature of any size or 50 lbs. of inanimate mass. The effect has close range and requires a
standard action and an attack check to touch the subject. Its range can be improved with the Range extra while its
required action can be changed with the Action modifier. In addition to Parry and Dodge to avoid the attack the target
gets Fortitude or Will check (chosen when this modifier is applied) vs DC 10. A successful check negates the effect but
failure means that the target is affected by a number of ranks equal to degrees of success with a maximum of the number
of ranks you have in the effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You control the effect, and maintain it, if it has a duration longer than instant unlike the
Affects Others modifier in which the target controls the effect. You can't have Affects Others on an Attack. If an
effect starts out as an attack or is removable then you may attack yourself for free.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you want both versions of an Attack effect, such as being able to Teleport yourself and
Teleport others as an attack, take both as Alternate Effects. For the ability to use both options simultaneously--to
teleport a target and yourself at the same time, for example--take the effects as separate powers.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-CONTAGIOUS"></a>CONTAGIOUS +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Contagious effects work on both the target and anyone coming into contact with the target. New
targets resist the effect normally. They also become contagious, and the effect lingers until all traces of it have been
eliminated. A Contagious effect is also eliminated if its duration expires. Examples of effects with this extra include
"sticky" Afflictions trapping anyone touching them, disease- or toxin-based Weaken effects, or even a Nullify effect
spreading from one victim to another. Contagious is almost exclusive to disease, poison, or chemical (being on fire is
naturally Contagious) any other effect must have a very good reason.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DIMENSIONAL"></a>DIMENSIONAL FLAT 1-3 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier allows an effect to work on targets in other dimensions (if any exist in the
series). You affect your proximate location in the other dimension as if you were actually there, figuring range
modifiers from that point.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">One rank in Dimensional can affect a single other dimension. Two ranks can affect any of a
related group of dimensions (mythic dimensions, mystic dimensions, fiendish planes, and so forth). Three ranks can reach
into any other dimension in the setting.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For many effects, you may need a Dimensional Remote Sensing effect to target them. Targets in
other dimensions you cannot sense have total concealment from you.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-EXISTENCE-DEPENDENT"></a>EXISTENCE DEPENDENT 0 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier can only be applied to Instant effects that have the <b>Reversible</b> modifier.
When the device or character with the effect loses the power (it must be lost not just countered or nullified) all
targets affected by the power have the effects reversed automatically. This also triggers upon character death or device
destruction. This does not simply make Instant effects act as Continuous duration since you may still use the effect on
any number of targets.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-EXTENDED-RANGE"></a>EXTENDED RANGE FLAT 1 POINT PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier extends the distance over which a ranged effect works. This modifier can only be
applied to effects with range of ranged otherwise see Reach and Increased Range. Each application of Extended Range
increases the effect's short range by 1 distance rank keeping in mind that medium range is 1 more than short range and
long range is 2 more than short range. So 1 rank makes short range (0 + applications = 60 ft.), medium range (1 +
applications = 120 ft.) and long range (2 + applications = 250 ft.).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The GM may set limits on the maximum Extended Range an effect can have; as a general guideline,
effects used on a planetary surface are limited to the distance to the horizon (beyond which the curvature of the planet
makes it impossible to see anything to target it). On Earth at sea level, this is roughly three miles (distance rank
10).</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FASTER-ACTION"></a>FASTER ACTION +1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The action type for an effect is grouped as follows from slowest to fastest: Slow, Full,
Standard, Move, Free, Reaction, and Triggered. Each application speeds up the action from that effect's action type
(move to free, for example) and is worth +1 cost per rank. To change an effect from reaction to triggered you must first
have the <a href="#TOC-SELECTIVE">Selective</a> modifier. Permanent effects have an action type listed as None which
can't be modified. See Chapter 8: Action &amp; Adventure: ACTION TYPES for a full description of each type.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When you apply this modifier to make an effect Triggered choose which conditions are set. You
can have any number of conditions but some of them may depend on perception or knowledge in which case they might fail
to activate. There is also a default behavior: whether it should or should not activate if no conditions are met (in the
former case the conditions would be cases where it should not activate). The effect will activate as often as possible
as long as the conditions are met to do so (such as the case of the default behavior). The conditions can only be set
when appling this modifier unless you take a Flat 2 point modifier (called Resetable Triggers) which allows you to
change conditions as a free action (not a reaction). Recall that attacks and others have a usage limitation that ignores
action taken (see <b>Chapter 8: Action &amp; Adventure: Action Limitations</b>). Setting up a triggered <b>Nullify</b>
will act as a barrier against the choose powers or descriptors.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FEATURE"></a>FEATURE FLAT 1 POINT PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The <b>Feature effect</b> can also serve as an effect modifier, essentially adding on some
minor additional capability or benefit to a basic effect. Although listed here as an extra, this is essentially the same
as having the Feature Linked to the base effect (see the <b>Linked</b> modifier later in this section); the Feature is
an intrinsic part of the overall power, rather than separate.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">As with the Feature effect, a Feature extra should be significant enough to be worth at least 1
character point and not solely based on the power's descriptors. So, for example, a fiery Ranged Damage effect does not
need a Feature to ignite fires; doing so is part of its "fire" descriptor and can be equally advantageous and
problematic. A Ranged Damage effect that consistently "brands" its target with a visible and traceable mark, on the
other hand, is an effect with an added Feature.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-HOMING"></a>HOMING FLAT 1 POINT PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier grants a ranged effect an additional opportunity to hit. If an attack check with
a Homing effect fails, it attempts to hit again on the start of your next turn, requiring only a free action to maintain
and allowing you to take other actions, including making another attack. The projectile by default uses the attacker's
senses since the user is telling the missile how to attack. If the user can't take free actions or descides not to then
the missile stops and misses. Each rank in Homing grants the effect one additional attack check, but it still only gets
one check per round.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The Homing effect uses the same accurate sense as the original attack to "track" its target, so
concealment effective against that sense according to the attacker may confuse the effect and cause it to miss. If a
Homing attack misses due to concealment or lacking a free action, it has lost its "lock" on the target and does not get
any further chances to hit. You can take Senses Linked to the Homing effect, if desired (to create things like
radar-guided or heat-seeking missiles, for example) in which case the attack no longer requires free actions from the
attacker. If a Homing attack is countered before it hits, it loses any remaining chances to hit. The same is true if it
hits a different target.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-IMPERVIOUS"></a>IMPERVIOUS FLAT 2 POINTS PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A defense with this modifier is highly resistant. Any effect with a resistance difficulty
modifier equal to or less than the Impervious rank has no effect. So, for example, Impervious Toughness 5 ignores any
Damage with a rank of 5 or less. Penetrating effects can overcome Impervious Resistance (see the <b>Penetrating</b>
extra description).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Impervious is primarily intended for Toughness resistance checks, to handle characters immune
to a certain threshold of damage, but it can be applied to other defenses with the GM's permission, to reflect
characters with certain reliable capabilities in terms of resisting particular effects or hazards. This modifier can be
applied directly to defenses without raising them or applied to Enhance Trait. The number of Impervious applications
can't exceed half your defense score (rounded up).</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INCREASED-DURATION"></a>INCREASED DURATION +1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The duration for an effect is grouped in order as follows: Concentration, Sustained,
Continuous, then Permanent. See <b>Duration </b>for details. This modifier increases an effect's duration from left to
right. Each duration increase cost +1 except going from Continuous to Permanent which is -1 therefore going from
Sustained to Permanent is free. Effects must have their base action type before becoming Permanent duration. Effects
that have a base duration of Instant can't have their durations changed. Also see <b>Decreased Duration</b>
modifier.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin">Going from Continuous to Permanent</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A continuous effect with Increased Duration becomes permanent in duration. It cannot be turned
off, it is always on by default. If some outside force--usually a Nullify effect--does turn it off, it turns back on
automatically at the earliest opportunity. Additionally, you cannot improve a permanent effect using extra effort.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Permanent effects may be inconvenient at times (including things like being permanently
incorporeal or 30 feet tall). Being unable to turn off and unable to improve it with extra effort is why this is a -1
rank flaw.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INCREASED-MASS"></a>INCREASED MASS FLAT 3 POINTS PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier can only be applied to one of the following: <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/transform-control.html">Transform</a>, <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/create-control.html">Create</a>, <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/movement-movement.html">Movement</a> (Dimension Travel and Time Travel), and <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/teleport-movement.html">Teleport</a>. Each rank of this extra increases the mass rank
involved with the effect by 1. So Increased Mass 3 on <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/teleport-movement.html">Teleport</a> allows you to carry up to 400 lbs. of extra mass
with you when you teleport, for example.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Since <a href="effects/effect-descriptions/movement-movement.html">Movement</a> and <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/teleport-movement.html">Teleport</a> are personal range by default, you must be
touching the mass to take it with you. Unwilling passengers get a Parry resistance check to avoid your unarmed attack to
touch them. If <a href="effects/effect-descriptions/teleport-movement.html">Teleport</a> is not personal range then this
modifier increases the amount of extra mass the target can take with them.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">In order to carry extra mass with any other kind of <a
href="effects/effect-descriptions/movement-movement.html">Movement</a> depends on how much mass you can carry, based on
strength, and your ability to grab. See <b>Chapter 8: Action &amp; Adventure: Actions</b>.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INCREASED-RANGE"></a>INCREASED RANGE +1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Effects have a standard range: close, ranged, or perception in increasing order. See
<b>Range</b> for details. This modifier increases an effect's range by one step per application but going from ranged to
perception costs +2 points. So that making a close effect into ranged is +1 and a close effect into perception ranged
effect is +3 cost per rank. This modifier can't increasing the range from personal to close, instead see either
<b>Affects Others</b> or <b>Attack</b> extras.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INDIRECT"></a>INDIRECT FLAT 1-4 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A ranged effect with this modifier can originate from a point other than the user, ignoring
cover between the user and the target, such as walls and other intervening barriers, so long as they do not provide
cover between the effect's origin point and the target. An Indirect effect normally originates from a fixed point
directed away from you. In some cases, an Indirect effect may count as a surprise attack (see <b>Surprise Attack</b>).
This modifier can't be applied to area effects. These two modifiers are exclusive you must remove one to gain the
other.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Indirect 1</b>: the effect originates from a fixed point away from you.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Indirect 2</b>: the effect can come from any point away from you or a fixed point in a fixed
direction (not away from you).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Indirect 3</b>: The effect can come from any point in a fixed direction (not away from you)
or a fixed point in any direction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Indirect 4</b>: The effect can originate from any point and aim in any direction, including
towards you (hitting a target in front of you from behind, for example).</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INNATE"></a>INNATE +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this modifier is an innate part of your nature and unaffected by Nullify (see
the <b>Nullify</b> effect). Gamemasters should exercise caution in allowing the application of Innate; the effect must
be a truly inborn or essential trait, such as an elephant's size or a ghost's incorporeal nature. If the effect is not
something normal to the character's species or type, it probably isn't innate.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INSIDIOUS"></a>INSIDIOUS FLAT 1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier is similar to the Subtle modifier (later in this section), except Insidious makes
the result of an effect harder to detect rather than the effect itself. For example, a target suffering from Insidious
Damage isn't even aware he's been damaged. Someone affected by an Insidious Weaken feels fine until some deficiency
makes it obvious that he's weaker, and so forth. A target of an Insidious effect may remain unaware of the danger until
it's too late!</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An Insidious effect is detectable either by a DC 20 skill check (usually Perception, although
skills like Expertise, Insight, or Treatment may apply in other cases) or a particular unusual sense, such as an
Insidious magical effect noticeable by Detect Magic or Magical Awareness.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that Insidious does not make the effect itself harder to notice; apply the Subtle modifier
for that. So it is possible for an active Insidious effect to be noticeable: the target can perceive the use of the
effect, but not its results: the effect appears "harmless" or doesn't seem to "do anything" since the target cannot
detect the results. The asymmetry between Insidious and Subtle in that Subtle can be completely undetectable is
intentional: it should not ever be impossible to detect the power's result.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-LINKED"></a>LINKED 0 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier applies to two or more effects, linking them together so they only work in
conjunction as one.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The Linked effects need not operate at the same range in which case it is possible to avoid the
shorter range while still being hit by the longer. The action required to use the combined effects is the longest of its
components and they use a single attack check (if one is required) but each effect's resistance check is rolled
separately. The Linked effects need not have the same duration however unlike activation which is done as a single
action each of them must be maintained seperately but if any of them end then the all end. An exception is made for
Instant effects so that they activate along with the others but do not cause the others to end and the instant effect
will not activate again when each other effect is maintained.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Super Wizard can disappear in a blinding flash of light. The effect is Affliction: visually impaired, visually disabled, visually unaware linked with Sustained Invisibility linked with Concentration Insubstantial. When activating, all 3 effects activate at the same time using a Standard action (because Affliction is the slowest action compared to Free) and on each turn after that he must use a Standard action to concentrate on Insubstantial and a free action to maintain Invisibility. Failing to maintain either of them will cause both to end. If he wants to use the Affliction again he must stop using the other effects then activate them again.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Different Alternate Effects cannot be Linked since they can't be used at the same time by
definition. Generally, the same effect cannot be Linked to itself to "multiply" the results of a failed resistance check
(such as two Linked Damage effects causing "double damage" on a failed check) instead use the higher rank of the two
effects. Attacks can't be linked to the same base effects: always use the highest ranking of them. Enhanced Trait (of
the same trait) and Healing can also never be linked to themselves. If a power has a choice to be made upon obtaining
such as Affliction choosing conditions. Luck Control, Nullify choosing what it can counter, but not things like
Affliction choosing its modifiers and descriptors, then the effect is considered a different base power in order to link
them together. For example in the case of Damage limited only to machines linked with Damage limited only to aliens the
difference is only a modifier and use the higher ranking one that applies (of course in this case unless it is an alien
machine only one or none of them will apply anyway).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier does not change the cost of the component effects; simply add their costs
together to get the combined effect's cost.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Captain Thunder has the ability to hurl thunderbolts that shock their targets with electricity and deafen them with powerful claps of thunder. This is a Ranged Damage effect (lightning), costing 2 points per rank, Linked to a Ranged Affliction (deafening thunder), costing 2 points per rank. The combined effect costs 4 points per rank.Since both effects are ranged and require a standard action to use, so does the combined effect. Since Damage requires a Toughness check and Affliction requires a Dodge check, the target checks against them separately, making a Toughness resistance check against the damage of the lightning and a Dodge check to avoid being deafened by the thunder. Since the two effects are Linked, Captain Thunder cannot throw a lightning bolt without the deafening thunderclap, nor can he attempt to merely deafen a target without also hitting them with lightning! (To do these things, Cap might take the stand-alone effects as Alternate Effects.)</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-MULTIATTACK"></a>MULTIATTACK +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A Multiattack effect allows you to hit multiple targets, or a single target multiple times, in
the same standard action. Multiattack can apply to any effect requiring an attack check. If the Multiattack damage is
strength based and your strength increases you retain the full benefits of Multiattack.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">There are two ways in which a Multiattack effect can be used:</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-SINGLE-TARGET"></a>SINGLE TARGET</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">To use a Multiattack against a single target, make your attack check normally. If successful,
increase the attack's resistance check DC by +2 for two degrees of success, and +5 for three or more. This circumstance
bonus does not count against power level limits.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If an Impervious Resistance would ignore the attack before any increase in the DC, then the
attack still has no effect as usual; a volley of multiple shots is no more likely to penetrate Impervious Resistance
than just one.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-MULTIPLE-TARGETS"></a>MULTIPLE TARGETS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can use Multiattack to hit multiple targets at once by "walking" or "spraying" the
Multiattack across an arc. If you have not yet used your move action then you may use it during this maneuver to attack
from any of the squares along the way otherwise each attack must be from where you are now. Roll one attack check per
target in the arc with a maximum of 5 targets. You suffer a penalty to each check equal to the total number of targets.
So making a Multiattack against five targets is a -5 penalty to each attack check. If you miss one target, you may still
attempt to hit the others.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-PENETRATING"></a>PENETRATING FLAT 2 POINTS PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Your effect overcomes Impervious Resistance to a degree; the target must make a resistance
check against an effect rank equal to your Penetrating rank. So, if a rank 4 (Penetrating 2) effect hits a target with
Impervious 5, the target must resist a rank 2 effect (equal to the Penetrating rank). If the effect were rank 6, the
target would have to resist the full effect anyway, since its rank is greater than the Impervious rank. You cannot have
a Penetrating rank greater than your effect rank.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-PRECISE"></a>PRECISE FLAT 1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can use a Precise effect to perform tasks requiring delicacy and fine control, such as
using Precise Damage to spot-weld or carve your initials, Precise Move Object to type or pick a lock, Precise
Environment to match a particular temperature exactly, and so forth. The GM has final say as to what tasks can be
performed with a Precise effect and may require an ability, skill, or power check to determine the degree of precision
with any given task.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-REACH"></a>REACH FLAT 1 POINT PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Each time you apply this modifier to a close range effect, you extend its reach by 6 feet. This
may represent a short-ranged effect or one with a somewhat greater reach, like a whip, spear, or similar weapon. The
default reach is 6 feet.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-REVERSIBLE"></a>REVERSIBLE FLAT 1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This can only be applied to Instant duration effects. You can remove conditions caused by your
Reversible effects at will as a free action, so long as the subject is within the effect's range. Examples include
removing the damage conditions caused by a Damage effect, repairing damage done by Weaken Toughness, or removing an
Affliction instantly. normally, you have no control over the results of such effects.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-RICOCHET"></a>RICOCHET FLAT 1 POINT PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can ricochet or bounce an attack effect with this modifier off of a solid surface to change
its direction. This allows you to attack around corners, overcome cover and possibly make a surprise attack against an
opponent. It does not allow you to affect multiple targets. The "bounce" has no effect apart from changing the attack's
direction. You must be able to define a clear path for your attack, which must follow a straight line between each
ricochet. Each rank in Ricochet allows you to bounce the attack once before it hits. Ricochet may grant a bonus to hit
due to surprise, at the GM's discretion.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SECONDARY"></a>SECONDARY EFFECT +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An instant duration effect with this modifier affects the target once immediately (when the
effect is used) and then once again on the following round, at the end of the attacker's turn. The target gets the
normal resistance check against the secondary effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Secondary Effects don't stack, so if you attack a target with your Secondary Effect on the
round after a successful hit, it doesn't affect the target twice; it simply delays the second effect for another round.
You can attack the target with a different effect, however. So, for example, if you hit a target with a Secondary Damage
Effect then, on the following round, hit with an Affliction, the target suffers both the Affliction and the Secondary
Damage.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SELECTIVE"></a>SELECTIVE +1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A resistible effect with this extra is discriminating, allowing you to decide who is and is not
affected by it. This is most useful for area effects (see the <b>Area</b> extra). You must be able to accurately
perceive a target in order to decide whether or not to affect it. Any target that is not perceived can only be affected
if you decide to affect that entire square, this includes the floor and all inanimate objects if the effect can affect
objects. For a degree of selectivity with non-resistible effects, use the Precise modifier.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SPLIT"></a>SPLIT FLAT 1 POINT PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">With this modifier, a resistible effect that works on one target can split between two. The
attacker chooses how many ranks to apply to each target up to the effect's total rank. So a rank 10 effect could be
split 5/5, 4/6, 2/8, 10/0 (for a single target), or any other total adding up to 10. If an attack check is required, the
attacker makes one, comparing the results against each target. Each target must be within range from where you are now,
the effect splits before leaving your square. The effect works on each target at its reduced rank.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If the power has a duration longer than Instant you may end any number of ranks at a time so
that you may use some on another target. The number of affected targets must still not exceed your number of Split
ranks. If a single target is under an effect and splits into multiple targets, such as the feature Fission or by
detroying the object, it is still considered a single target to that power and the effect applies to each of them until
the effect is completely removed from each target.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Each additional rank of this modifier allows the power to split an additional time, so rank 2
allows an effect to split among three targets, then four, and so forth. An effect cannot split to fractional ranks per
target and cannot apply more than one split to the same target. Thus the maximum Split rank equals the effect's rank. If
you have a large number of ranks in Split consider a Selective Cone Area instead.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SUBTLE"></a>SUBTLE FLAT 1-2 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Subtle effects are not as noticeable. A subtle effect may be used to catch a target unaware and
may in some cases qualify for a surprise attack. Rank 1 makes an effect difficult to notice; a DC 20 Perception check is
required, or the effect is noticeable only to certain exotic senses (at the GM's discretion). Rank 2 makes the effect
completely undetectable.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-VARIABLE-DESCRIPTOR"></a>VARIABLE DESCRIPTOR FLAT 1-2 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can change the descriptors of an effect with this modifier, varying them as a free action
once per round. With rank 1, you can apply any of a closely related group of descriptors, such as weather,
electromagnetic, temperature, and so forth. With rank 2, you can apply any of a broad group, such as any mental,
magical, or technological descriptor. You can add or remove any number of descriptors but must always have at least the
one that describes the category such as mental or magical. The GM decides if a given descriptor is appropriate in
conjunction with a particular effect and this modifier.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px"><a name="TOC-FLAWS"></a>FLAWS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">The following section lists available flaws, starting with the flaw's name and the amount it
reduces effect cost (in character points per rank or flat value), along with a description of how the flaw modifies

<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-ACTIVATION"></a>ACTIVATION FLAT -1 OR -2 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A power with this flaw requires an action to prepare or activate before any of its effects are
usable. If the power requires a move action to activate, the flaw is -1 point. If it requires a standard action, it is
-2 points. Activation taking less than a move action is not a flaw, although may qualify as a complication (see the
<b>Power Loss</b> complication for details). Whenever the power (or group) is deactivated it goes through <b>Power
Loss</b> (although usually ammunition is not affected).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Activation has no effect other than making the power or group's effects available for use. The
effects themselves still require their normal actions to use. You can use a power's effects in the same turn as you
activate it, provided you have sufficient actions to do so. If the power is deactivated--either voluntarily or
involuntarily via effects like Nullify--you must activate it again in order to use any of its effects not to be confused
with ending an effect's duration. A device may have this modifier to represent a requirement to first turn the device
on.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Activation applies to an entire power and all of its effects. Activating the power brings all
of its effects "online" and makes them available. If you have to activate different effects separately, apply this flaw
to each of them, requiring separate actions for each.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If Activation is not automatic, apply the Check Required flaw to the entire power as well and
have the player make the necessary check in order to activate the power. If the check fails, the power does not
activate, and the character has to take the activation action to try again.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-ACTIVATION-AND-PERMANENT-EFFECTS"></a>ACTIVATION AND PERMANENT EFFECTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The Activation flaw does allow permanent effects that are part of a power to be turned off, but
only if the power as a whole is deactivated. It does not affect the other aspects of permanent duration, including the
inability to improve the effect with extra effort. The GM should decide if allowing a permanent effect to have an
Activation is appropriate based on the specific effect and any others it is combined with in the power.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Stonewall has the power to turn into a super-strong rock-form. This is a combination of the Enhanced Strength, Impervious Protection, and Power-Lifting effects. Stonewall's player applies the Activation flaw to the power, saying Stonewall has to concentrate and take a standard action to assume his rock-form. That reduces the total cost of all three effects by 2 character points (not 2 points each for 6 points) and means unless Stonewall takes a standard action to activate his rock-form, he cannot use any of the power's effects, even including permanent ones like Protection.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT"></a>ALTERNATE EFFECT FLAT -? (-1/2) POINTS</h3>

<div style="font-weight:bold;background-color:rgb(153,0,0);padding:5px;color:rgb(255,255,255)">Under the Hood: Choosing Alternate Effects</div>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:rgb(244,204,204)">
<div style="padding:5px">Arrays--collections of Alternate Effects--are one of the more complex and important constructs
and require some special care in terms of their creation and use. Players should take these things into account when
creating characters with arrays, and Gamemasters should consider them when approving such characters and dealing with
them in play.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The main reason for the Alternate Effect modifier is to allow a degree of flexibility in terms
of a character's power effects within the cost restrictions laid down by having a finite number of character points.
It's based on the assumption that a wide range of powers has a diminishing return in terms of value, since characters
can only use so many effects at once. A power with various "settings," usable one at a time, is more valuable than a
power with only one, but not as valuable as various effects all usable at the same time.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">However, Alternate Effect can be abused to try and squeeze the most "efficiency" out of a
character's character points, gaining the most effects for the lowest cost. The guidelines for Alternate Effects are
intended to help limit this somewhat, but there is no way they can eliminate the possibility entirely and still provide
all the benefits of flexibility they're intended to offer. Some Gamemaster oversight is therefore necessary when it
comes to the creation and use of arrays.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Before giving a character Alternate Effects, it is wise to ask, "Is an array really needed for
this concept?" Some concepts, such as a variety of different settings of a lazer gun, clearly call for an array. Others,
like a power with a few rarely used stunts, may not call for an array. Such a power may be better served by acquiring
such occasional stunts through extra effort and the spending of victory points rather than the creation of a permanent
set of Alternate Effects. That is what the power stunts rules are for, after all: so you do not have to fill up
character sheets with minor Alternate Effects a hero will rarely ever use.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Alternate Effects must have a good explaination of relation following the same guidelines as a
power stunt. Indeed Alternate Effects are simply power stunts that you buy to avoid extra effort. Although if the
Alternate Effect is used more often than the main effect the GM might require you to pay the full cost of the effect for
it to no longer be alternate.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Alternate Effect can only be applied to effects that could possibly be used at once and
therefore this can generally not be applied to damage, healing, or movement effects since (for example) multiple
damaging effects can never be used at the same time anyway.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you decide an array is appropriate, the first thing is to determine its overall theme and
associated descriptors. Is it a collection of regular power stunts for a themed power like earth control? And so forth.
Arrays should have some unifying theme beyond "all the powers I want my hero to have" or "they are all powered by my
spellcasting or battlesuit" and Gamemasters should feel free to veto inappropriate arrays lacking a strong theme.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier allows you to "swap-out" the effect for an entire other, alternate, effect! For
example, a Damage effect with the descriptor of "laser" might have a visual Dazzle as an Alternate Effect: the same
light beam can be used to damage or blind a target, just not both at once. Think of Alternate Effects as different
"settings" for a power. (For combinations of effects that work simultaneously, see the <b>Linked</b> modifier in this
section.) A set of Alternate Effects is called an <b>array</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An Alternate Effect can have any rank, or combination of modifiers. Alternate Effects may also
have different descriptors, usually thematically linked, within reason. This allows you to have two versions of a Damage
effect, for example: such as a fire blast and an ice blast. Permanent effects cannot have Alternate Effects, nor can
they be Alternate Effects (since they can't be turned on and off).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An Alternate Effect can have a total cost in character points no greater than the primary
effect. So a rank 10 primary effect costing 2 points per rank, for a total of 20, can have any Alternate Effect with a
cost of 20 character points or less. This cost does not include the cost of the Alternate Effect modifier itself. So if
the 20-point power has 5 Alternate Effects, each Alternate Effect is still limited to a total value of 20 points
(including any modifiers it may have), that of the base effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">To determine the cost of an Alternate Effect first count how much the effect would normally
cost (this must be less than or equal to the main effect) then divide that by 2 rounded down. For clarity: the point
value of <b>Alternate Effect</b> is rounded down meaning the power total cost is rounded up. For example a power that
would normally cost 3 points as an alternate effect instead costs a total of 2 points.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Like any power, an Alternate Effect may be made up of two or more effects, but their total cost
cannot exceed the cost of the primary effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Alternate Effects cannot be used or maintained at the same time as other Alternates in the same
array; they are mutually exclusive. Switching between Alternates requires first to deactivate (stop maintaining as a
free action) the current power then take whatever action is required for the next effect, this can be done once per
turn. If anything disables, nullifies, or drains any power in an array, all of them are affected in the same way.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-AMMUNITION"></a>AMMUNITION -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A power with this flaw can only be used a certain number of times between reloading. The number
of times must be at least 50% hindering in the same fashion as the Limited rank flaw. Choose how many uses per what time
interval the power has such as 1/day or how many times it can be used until needing to reload such as 5/reload.
Reloading is by default a standard action and by default you have unlimited Ammunition clips to reload with: running out
of clips of Ammunition is a complication. This flaw may be applied again for the number of uses to be reduced to 25%
effectiveness such as 1/(2 weeks). For effects that are not Instant duration instead use a total amount of usage time
such as 20 rounds/day. Also see the rank flaw Fades and complications</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A gun-toting vigilante, Marksman has a variety of guns (acquired via the Equipment advantage). Each must be reloaded periodically. He wears a belt of ammunition clips so that reloading isn't a concern, no matter how many shots he fires or how many thugs he guns down. When, during a long fire-fight, the Gamemaster decides that Marksman's belt has used up every clip, the player gets a victory point for the complication, forcing the hero to come up with a new plan, fast!</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-CHECK-REQUIRED"></a>CHECK REQUIRED FLAT -1 POINT PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw requires a check of some sort--usually a skill check--with a
difficulty class of 10 + ranks in Check Required. If the check fails, the effect doesn't work, although the action
required to use it is expended (so attempting to activate a standard action effect takes a standard action whether the
check is successful or not).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If the check succeeds, the character gains the use of 1 effect rank per point the check exceeds
the DC. Thus a check result of 14 allows the character to use up to 4 ranks of the effect. If a lesser rank of the
effect doesn't do anything, then it's the same as failing the check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The required check occurs as part of the action to use the effect and provides no benefit other
than helping to activate it. Normal modifiers apply to the check, and if you are unable to make the required check for
any reason, the effect doesn't work.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A critical success or critical failure can still occur normally on this check. So there is
always a small chance the effect won't work, regardless of the character's check bonus.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This check must be in addition to any check(s) normally required for the effect. So, for
example, the normal perception check made in conjunction with a sensory effect does not count as an application of this
flaw, and applying it means an additional check is required before the effect's normally required check(s).</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A spellcaster has Senses 4 (Detect Magic, Ranged, Acute, Analyze) with Expertise: Magic Check Required 4. The player needs to make a DC 14 skill check (10 + 4 flaw ranks) to successfully cast the spell, followed by the normal Perception check to pick up on anything present, and perhaps another Expertise check to interpret what the character senses.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">CHECK EXAMPLES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Skill checks an effect may require include:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Acrobatics</b>: Suitable for effects requiring a measure of coordination or complex
maneuvering.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Deception</b>: Good for effects intended to deceive, particularly sensory effects like
Concealment or Illusion, and disguise or form-altering effects like Morph.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Expertise</b>: An Expertise skill check might represent having to know something about the
subject of the effect or having to know something about the effect itself.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Intimidation</b>: Useful for effects intended to inspire fear as well as similar offensive
effects like Affliction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Stealth</b>: Best suited to sensory effects, particularly Concealment.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Technology</b>: Operating a complex device may require a Technology check.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DECREASED-DURATION"></a>DECREASED DURATION -1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The duration for an effect is grouped in order as follows: Permanent, Continuous, Sustained,
then Concentration. See <b>Duration</b> for details. This modifier decreases an effect's duration from left to right.
Each duration decrease cost -1 except going from Permanent to Continuous which is +1 therefore going from Permanent to
Sustained is free. Effects that have a base duration of Instant can't have their durations changed. Also see
<b>Increased Duration</b> modifier.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin">Going from Permanent to Sustained</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A permanent duration effect that becomes sustained duration now requires a free action to use
(rather than none, like other permanent effects). The benefit is the sustained effect can be improved using extra
effort, including using it to perform power stunts. The drawback is the effect requires a free action each turn to
maintain it, and being unable to do so means the effect shuts off.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The Protection effect is permanent by default, meaning it always protects the character, but concentrating or trying harder does not make the effect more protective, nor can the character use it for power stunts. Sustained Protection can be turned on and off, improved with extra effort, and used for power stunts. It might represent a power like a personal force field, or increased density requiring a modicum of concentration to maintain.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DIMINISHED-RANGE"></a>DIMINISHED RANGE FLAT -1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Diminished Range reduces the effect's short, medium, and long ranges. This flaw reduces the
effect's short range by 1 distance rank keeping in mind that medium range is 1 more than short range and long range is 2
more than short range so that the 3 distances are 15 ft, 30 ft, and 60 ft. This flaw can't be applied again for that
change the effect range to close range with Reduced Range (with an alternate resistance if you insist).</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DISTRACTING"></a>DISTRACTING -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Using a Distracting effect requires more concentration than usual, causing you become
vulnerable when you use the effect, until the start of your next turn. The turn after you activate the power you are no
longer vulnerable and if the power has a duration other than instant you may continue to use the power without being
vulnerable. The power's duarion need not be concentration. This flaw can be applied to Instant effects as well as
lasting ones but not Permanent since it is never activated.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FADES"></a>FADES -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Each time you use an effect with this flaw, it loses 1 rank of effectiveness. For effects with
a duration longer than instant, each round is considered "one use." Once the effect reaches 0 ranks, it stops working. A
faded effect can be "recovered" in some fashion, such as recharging, rest, repair, reloading, and so forth. The GM
decides when and how a faded effect recovers, but it should generally occur outside of combat and take at least an
hour's time. The GM may allow a hero to recover a faded effect immediately and completely by spending a victory
point.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FEEDBACK"></a>FEEDBACK -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You suffer damage when a manifestation of your effect is damaged. This flaw only applies to
effects with physical (or apparently physical) manifestations, such as Create, Illusion, or Summon, for example. But it
may also be applied to any power if the descriptor contains something physical, such as using Nano-bots, note that
Flight's Platform flaw could also have Feedback. If your power's manifestation is damaged, make a resistance check
against the attack's damage rank, using your effect's rank as the resistance check bonus. For example, if a
manifestation of a rank 10 effect is attacked for damage 12, you must make a resistance check against damage 12 with a
+10 bonus (the effect's rank) in place of your normal Toughness.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FRAGILE"></a>FRAGILE FLAT -? (-2 - 1 per application see below) POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This can only be applied to a device, that is to say that the effect must first have the
removable flaw. This flaw subtracts 1 flat point for every 1 point of toughness it loses (see material toughness table
in Ch8 action &amp; adventure: DAMAGING OBJECTS) and an addition flat 2 point reduction for having the same limitations
as equipment (see ch7 gadgets gear: EQUIPMENT). The additional 2 points are not optional meaning this flaw is always
worth at least 2 points. Fragile can't reduce a device's Toughness to less then 0. Note that equipment has both
removable and fragile and is so cheap is due to it being commonly available for any citizen with exceptions for
government regulations on weapons and technology availability.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-GRAB-BASED"></a>GRAB-BASED -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An attack effect with this flaw requires you to successfully grab a target before using the
effect (see <b>Grab</b>). This generally applies to an effect that is close range, since grab by default is close range
anyway. The effect's range must be within range while you are grabbing. If you do not succeed on the grab, you cannot
use the effect. If your grab attempt succeeds, the effect occurs automatically as a reaction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Leech has a draining touch that is a Grab-Based Weaken Strength effect. So the monstrous villain has to take a standard action and make a grab first in order to use it. If his close attack check hits, the target makes a Dodge or Fortitude resistance check against Leech's Strength. If it fails, the target then makes the Fortitude resistance check against the villain's Weaken effect to see how much Strength Leech drains away.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This flaw is essentially a form of Resistible, with a grab check rather than a regular
resistance check (see the <b>Resistible</b> flaw for more).</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INACCURATE"></a>INACCURATE FLAT -1 POINT PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw is hard to control or wildly inaccurate. Each application gives you a
-2 penalty to attack checks with the effect.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-LIMITED"></a>LIMITED -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw is not effective all the time. Limited powers generally break down
into two types: those usable only in certain situations and those usable only on certain things. For example Only While
Singing Loudly, Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth.
As a general rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to qualify for this modifier. Anything that is
effective more than half the time is better handled as an occasional complication. This flaw can be applied again if an
effect is only about 25% as effective. Also see <b>Unreliable</b>.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-PARTIALLY-LIMITED"></a>PARTIALLY LIMITED</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If your effect is only somewhat effective in particular circumstances, apply the flaw to only
some of its ranks. For example, an attack effect that does less damage against targets with Protection (to represent a
diminished ability to penetrate armor, for example) applies the Limited flaw to only those ranks that are
ineffective.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-NOTICEABLE"></a>NOTICEABLE FLAT -1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A continuous or permanent effect with this modifier is noticeable in some sort of way (see
<b>Noticing Power Effects</b>). Choose a noticeable display for the effect. For example Noticeable Protection may take
the form of armored plates or a tough, leathery-looking hide, making it clear the character is tougher than
normal.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-QUIRK"></a>QUIRK FLAT -1 POINT PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A Quirk is some minor nuisance attached to an effect, essentially the reverse of a Feature (see
<b>Feature</b> under <b>Extras</b>). A Quirk is generally worth, at most, 2-3 character points, and many are simply
1-point flaws.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">As with Features, the GM should ensure a Quirk is truly a flaw (albeit a minor one) and not
simply part of the power's descriptors. For example, the fact that an attack with a "sonic" descriptor likely will not
travel through a vacuum is not a Quirk, simply part of the "sonic" descriptor (especially since the attack may be
enhanced by a medium such as water). On the other hand, a shapeshifter unable to change color (losing some of the
power's utility), or a telepath unable to lie while using Mental Communication, do have Quirks to their powers.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The GM sets the rank (and therefore value) of any given Quirk for an effect, based on how
troublesome it may be, similar to setting ranks for the Benefit advantage and Feature effect (see those trait
descriptions for details). Having multiple quirks is possible but should not sum up to more than 5.</div>

<div style="padding:5px">An effect has a range of perception, ranged, or close in decreasing order. Decreasing an
effect's range by one step (from ranged to close, for example) is worth -1 cost per rank but going from Perception to
Ranged is worth -2. So that going from Perception to Close is worth a total of -3. Effects that are close range can't
further decrease their range to personal instead see <b>Side Effect</b>.</div>

<div style="padding:5px">Items provided by the Equipment advantage (see <b>Advantages</b>) are essentially effects and
other traits with Easily Removable and Fragile, along with the various other limitations outlined in the <a
href="../7-gadgets-gear.html">Gadgets &amp; Gear</a> so that the Equipment advantage provides 5 points worth of
equipment per rank (or 1 character point) despite the fact that removable can never reduce an effect below 1 point.
Although weapons and armor cost 1/5 of the price.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Effects with this flaw can be "taken away" from you, removing your access to the effects until
you regain it. Typically, this means a power that resides in an object, called a <b>device</b>, which someone else can
remove. There are two different versions of this flaw covered in the following paragraphs; the first is <b>Removable</b>
and the second is <b>Easily Removable</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A removable power may only be removed when you are both stunned and defenseless, essentially
unable to resist, and cannot be removed during action time. This means opponents can generally only remove the power
after defeating you (leaving you incapacitated) or through some sort of scheme outside of a conflict, such as a plot to
break into your headquarters and steal a device kept there, for example.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An easily removable power can be taken away with a disarm or grab action (see <a
href="../8-action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>). This typically represents a hand-held device (such as a
weapon, magic wand, remote control, or the like) or some worn item easily snatched from you, like a hat or cloak.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-REMOVABLE-POINT-VALUE"></a>POINT VALUE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Removable applies to the power as a whole and not individual effects, although it may apply to
a power with only one effect. The flaw is worth -1 point (-2 points for Easily Removable) per 5 total character points
of the power's final cost, after applying extras and flaws to its effects. The flaw value is always rounded down since
it occurs every 5 points only. Meaning that an easily removable 99 point group will cost a total of 61 (see following
example). Because this modifier applies to a group its value is determined after <b>Alternate Effect</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mistress Marine's armor provides Veronica with a number of effects, including Damage, Enhanced Strength, Flight, Protection, and Senses. The total character point cost of all the armors effects is 99 points, including extras and flaws applied to those effects. Dividing the total cost by 5 is 19 after rounding down. So the Removable flaw reduces the cost of the Mistress Marines armor by 19 points, from 99 to 80 character points. However the armor can be taken away, disabled, and so forth, and the player receives no victory points for a complication when it happens due to the nature of the flaw.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-REMOVABLE-AND-DAMAGE"></a>DAMAGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Removable devices can be damaged, possibly even destroyed (see <b>Damage</b> effect description
for details). So long as the character has character points invested in the device, it can be repaired, eventually. This
usually requires time between adventures, perhaps even a special adventure to find certain rare parts, specialized help,
or other components.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Devices have a base Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided by 5 (rounded
down, minimum of 1). This base Toughness is counted before removable and fragile are applied.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin"><a name="TOC-REMOVABLE-AND-COMPLICATIONS"></a>COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The temporary loss of a removable power does not constitute a complication, any more than the
result of any other flaw. You can have a device or power-object as a descriptor without this flaw, if you wish, in which
case the power cannot be removed or taken away from you without a complication applied by the GM (earning you a victory
point) or the use of an effect like Nullify, which has predefined conditions for recovery.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-RESISTIBLE"></a>RESISTIBLE -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When applied to an effect that doesn't normally allow a resistance check, this flaw gives it
one. Choose the defense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on others allow a resistance check by
definition, this nearly always applies to personal effects that allow someone interacting with them to circumvent the
effect with a successful check. The DC for the resistance is 10 + power rank whether for a skill or defense check, the
skill used must be possible to perform untrained.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For example, an Enhanced Parry defense effect might reflect a low-level reading of a target's
mind to anticipate and avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome the effect, denying you the defense
bonus against that opponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your Concealment effect might be illusory
rather than a true physical transformation, permitting an Insight (Awe) skill check for someone to overcome it. A
sustained Protection effect might be some sort of "kinetic field" that permits an attacker a Fortitude resistance check
to overcome it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When applied to an effect that does normally allow a resistance check, this flaw gives it an
additional one, which may be the same as its normal resistance, or different. The target makes both resistance checks
and applies the better of the two to determine the effect's result. The DC for the resistance is 10 + power rank whether
for a skill or defense check, the skill used must be possible to perform untrained.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For example, a Weaken effect based on a poison dart might add a Toughness check to see if the
dart penetrates the target's skin in addition to making the usual Fortitude check against the effect and the Dodge check
due to being a ranged effect the order of them is Dodge, Toughness then Fortitude.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SENSE-DEPENDENT"></a>SENSE-DEPENDENT -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The target of a Sense-Dependent effect must be able to perceive the effect for it to work. This
can't be applied to personal range effects because you can always sense yourself and therefore isn't a limitation
(instead see <b>complications</b>). The target gets a Dodge resistance check. Success means the target has managed to
avert his eyes, cover his ears, etc. and the effect doesn't work. Otherwise the effect works normally and the target
makes the usual resistance check against it, if any. Some senses can't be averted such as tactile in which case this
flaw is worth nothing and many exotic senses in which case this flaw is worth even more.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Opponents aware of a Sense-Dependent effect can also deliberately block the targeted sense:
looking away, covering or blocking their ears, etc. This provides a +10 bonus to resistance checks against the effect,
but gives others partial concealment from that sense. An opponent unable to use a sense (blind, deaf, etc.) is immune to
effects dependent on it. Opponents can do this by closing their eyes, wearing ear- or nose-plugs, or using another
effect like Concealment. This gives you total concealment from that sense.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Sensory effects are Sense-Dependent by definition, and cannot apply this flaw. To give a target
additional resistance to a sensory effect, use the Resistible flaw.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SIDE-EFFECT"></a>SIDE EFFECT -1 OR -2 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Failing to successfully use an effect with this flaw causes some problematic effect. Failure
includes missing an attack check, or the target successfully resisting the effect. If the side effect always occurs when
you use the effect, whether you succeed or fail, it is worth -2 cost per rank.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The exact nature of the side effect is for you and the Gamemaster to determine. As a general
guideline, it should be an effect about the same in value as the effect with this flaw. So an effect with a cost of 20
points should have a 20-point side effect. Typical side effects include Affliction, Damage, Weaken, or maybe Nullify.
The Side Effect does not require an attack check and only affects you, although the GM may permit some Side Effects with
the Area modifier on a case-by-case basis. You get a normal resistance check against the Side Effect. If you are immune
to your own powers, you aren't immune to its side-effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The GM may also allow a Complication Side Effect, which essentially imposes a complication on
you without awarding a victory point. See <b>Complications</b> for more information.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SLOWER-ACTION"></a>SLOWER ACTION -1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The action type for an effect is grouped as follows from fastest to slowest: Triggered,
Reaction, Free, Move, Standard, Full, and Slow. Each application slows down the action from that effect's action type
(free to move, for example) and is worth -1 cost per rank. Permanent effects have an action type listed as None which
can't be modified. See <b>Chapter 8: Action &amp; Adventure: ACTION TYPES</b> for a full description of each type.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SYSTEM-DEPENDENT"></a>SYSTEM DEPENDENT FLAT -2 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The System Dependent effect must be able to enter the target's system for it to work. Such as
inhalation, eating, skin contact, injection, etc. Thus a character with a closed system is immune to it as long as their
system remain closed. A closed system specifically is referring to Immunity but effects with this modifier can also be
avoided by holding breath or not eating etc.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-TIRING"></a>TIRING -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw causes you to suffer a level of fatigue when you use it. You recover
from this fatigue normally, and can use victory points to overcome it by spending the victory point at the start of the
round following the use of a tiring effect. In essence, the power requires extra effort in order to use it (see <b>Extra
Effort</b>). This makes Tiring a useful flaw for creating an effect you can only use with extra effort.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Tiring is often applied to just some ranks of an effect to represent a higher level of the
effect, usable only through extra effort. For example, a hero might have a rank 12 Damage effect, but routinely use only
8 ranks of it. The remaining 4 ranks are Tiring, so using them quickly fatigues the hero.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A Tiring effect can be combined with extra effort, but the fatigue stacks, causing a minimum of
two levels of fatigue per use.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-ACTIVATION"></a>UNCONTROLLABLE ACTIVATION -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You have no control over when an effect activates. This can only be applied to an effect that
has Triggered action. The trigger conditions must be assigned when the power is taken and can't be changed except during
point reallocation (which requires the Gamemaster's permission). The power can't be activated by choice and you can't
stop it from activating when the conditions are met. Like all flaws that change cost per rank it must be 50% limiting.
The fact that it can't be activated on demand is generally enough to be worth the cost. But, for example, Damage
triggered by saying the phrase "Judgement Strike" has virtually no downside as it can be activated at will and won't
accidently occur, this is better handled as a complication with a quirk.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-ENTIRELY"></a>UNCONTROLLABLE ENTIRELY -5 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You have no control over an effect with this flaw. Instead, the Gamemaster decides when and how
it works (essentially making it a plot device). This flaw is best suited for mysterious powers out of the characters'
direct control or effects the GM feels more comfortable having under direct, rather than player, control. You can no
longer even choose to activate it, this is very cheap since the GM can cause spontaneous effects anyway. The GM controls
every aspect of it: activation, duration, target, etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The great sorcerer Lincoln has a magic talisman that gives him advice of what to do next however he can't seem to activate it and only receives advice from it when he is really stumped or going in a completely wrong direction.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-RESULT"></a>UNCONTROLLABLE RESULT -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The result is random, this only applies to powers with variable results such as
<b>Illusion</b>, <b>Create</b>, and variable <b>Summon</b>. This is difficult at best to do randomly so the GM will
decide how to handle what happens. An example would be choosing to use Illusion and who it targets but not what they
see, this is fitting for hallucinations. For Create and Variable Summon you choose to activate it (and the location if
applicable) but the GM chooses what exactly is created or summoned.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-TARGET"></a>UNCONTROLLABLE TARGET -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can't control what the effect targets to some extent. This can't be applied to personal
range effects, ones with the <b>Selective</b> modifier, or ones that affect an <b>Area</b>. All characters who are
within the effect's range and that you can accurately perceive, including yourself and allies, have an equal chance of
being the effect's target.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For another application of this flaw instead of targeting a random character the effect targets
a random square on the map that is within range and that you can accurately perceive for a total of -2 cost per rank.
Every square, including your own, has an equal chance of being the target and if that square contains a character (being
on the other side of an invisible wall is out of range unless the effect is perception ranged) then that character is
targeted otherwise it targets whatever is in that square: objects, the ground, air, etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">In either case it is recommended that the GM rolls dice or has some way of determining the
result randomly. And if the target is invalid, such as effects that can't target yourself or targeting an object and you
can't affect objects, then the effect is countered.</div>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-UNRELIABLE"></a>UNRELIABLE -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An Unreliable effect doesn't work all the time. Randomly determine if the effect functions each
round before you use or maintain the effect, including continuous and permanent durations. Either flip a coin or roll a
single Fudge die having the effect function on positive or heads, and it doesn't work on tails or negative (reroll 0).
Even if the effect fails to work you've still used the action the effect requires. Spending a victory point on your
reliability roll allows you to succeed automatically (since the roll is then at least an 11).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Roll when first activating the effect and each turn you maintain it. If you fail the duration
ends as normal and you must take the normal action needed to activate the effect again. If you fail the roll when you
first activate the power instead the effect is countered. You are aware that you effect's duration ends and continuing
to concentrate would be pointless without first reactivating it. If you fail the roll with a permanent duration effect
it is considered countered until your next turn. Permanent effects use no action and will reactivate even if you can't
take any actions.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For another application the effect is only 25% reliable requiring the functional check twice
each round. Powers that are only occasionally unreliable (less than about 50% of the time) are better handled as
complications (see <b>Complications</b>.)</div>
