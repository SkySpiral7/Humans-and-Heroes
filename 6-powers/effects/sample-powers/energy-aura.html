Faster Action 4 (Triggered) <b>&#8226; 6 points per rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can surround your body with an aura of damaging energy or some similar effect. Typically
anyone you touch or that touches you is attacked by it (it can't miss and is close range) although you may set the
conditions. By default this excludes the floor from taking damage but any other objects are not exempt. In any case you
may actiavte it at any time as a reaction but keep in mind once you attack you can't attack again until your next turn
(see <b>Chapter 8 Action &amp; Adventure: Action Limitations</b>). The aura is always on and can't be turned off by
choice for that see any of the modifiers below.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Resetable Triggers</b>: This modifier allows you to reset the triggering conditions at any
time as a free action including the default behavior (ie whether it is on all the time or not). See <b>Faster Action</b>
for more details. <b>Flat 2 points</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Enhanced Trait</b>: Instead of simply buying energy aura you can buy Enhanced Trait: Energy
Aura for the same price since Enhanced Trait uses a Free action and is Sustained by default this means you can turn it
off and on as a free action. However being Sustained instead of Continuous means that it will deactivate whenever you
can't maintain it.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Activation</b>: This flaw allows you to turn off the aura as a free action however it
requires either a move or standard action to turn on. <b>Move: Flat -1 point. Standard: Flat -2 points</b></div>
