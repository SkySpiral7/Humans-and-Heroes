<div style="padding:5px">You are strong! Each rank of <b>Super-Strength</b> gives you the effects of <b>Power
Lifting</b>, <b>Leaping</b>, <b>Damage</b> (Strength-based). So with <b>Super-Strength</b> 10 you can lift and carry
rank 10 mass (26 tons), jump distance rank 8 (1.5 miles), and can attack with <b>Damage</b> 10 + strength.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Damage</b> is still limited by power level limits so that it has a maximum effective rank,
at that point you can still put ranks in <b>Power Lifting</b> and <b>Leaping</b> which have no maximum. You can buy the
three items separately: they do not need to be together this is simply a package for convenience and to demonstrate what
to buy to make a powerhouse (also see <a href="../../../2-secret-origins/powerhouse.html">Powerhouse</a>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Heroes with <b>Super-Strength</b> often have additional powers based on their strength such as
a thunder clap (Ranged <b>Affliction</b>: dazed, stunned, deaf (auditorily unaware)) or a ground strike (see <a
href="../../../2-secret-origins/powerhouse.html">Powerhouse</a>). High stamina, fortitude, and toughness is also common
for super strong characters.</div>
