<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="effect-general-morph">MORPH (GENERAL)</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can alter your appearance. Your traits do not change; your new form is merely a cosmetic
change and only visual. You can look exactly like your target limited by perception and knowledge of your target. Note
that this is only a visual change meaning you do not have the same voice as your target (see Linked below). You gain a
Disguise (Awe) bonus equal to checks to a power check for detailed changes (see <b>Disguise</b> guidelines for
<b>Deception</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Morph rank determines what form(s) you can assume: At rank 1 you can assume a single other
appearance. At rank 2 you can assume any of a narrow group of forms, such as people of roughly your size and gender, a
type of animal like birds or reptiles, and so forth. Although <b>Morph</b> never allows you to change your size or mass
rank (or volume) what is meant by "roughly your size" is someone of the same size and mass rank but also approximately
the same bodily proportions for example a 400 pound man whose weight is mostly due to muscle mass is not the same as a
400 pound obese man. At rank 3 you can assume any of a broad group of forms like humanoids, animals, machines, and so
forth. At rank 4 you can assume any form of the same mass rank and size rank as your own. Note that the default size for
a human is distance rank -2 (between 3 and 6 feet tall). Ranks above 4 exist only as cheaper <a
href="phantom-ranks-general.html">Phantom Ranks</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If your have Morph Attack that Affects Objects your ranks still determine what form(s) the
object can assume but are not the same as above. At rank 1 you can change the object's color and visual appearance but
not shape. At rank 2 you can make an object assume any form of the same mass rank and size rank but only of simple
shapes like those outlined in <a href="create-control.html">Create</a>. Slight modifications such as bending and
unbending of a more complicated shape are allowed. Keep in mind that these effects are only temporary.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Morph cannot be permanent in duration by definition. For the ability to change size as well as
appearance see the <a href="growth-general.html">Growth</a><b> </b>and <a href="shrinking-general.html">Shrinking</a>
effects. To take on the other traits of forms you assume, see the <a href="variable-general.html">Variable</a><b>
</b>effect.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Attack</b>: A Morph Attack imposes a different appearance on the target creature. This is
entirely cosmetic: you can't change the target's traits other than appearance although it is not uncommon for <a
href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a> to Link to Morph. <b>+1 points.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Linked Illusion</b>: Use minor illusions to trick senses beyond visual such as: mimic voice,
natural scent, etc. These illusions can't be resisted until your disguise is seen through or if the subject has
appropriate senses that counter illusions. If you want your visual appearance to be illusionary as well, use Illusion
entirely instead of Morph. <b>See <a href="illusion-control.html">Illusion</a> for cost</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Precise</b>: You can shape even the finer details that are not normally noticable except on
close examination. In the case of shaping objects this modifier is the same as described in <b>Create</b>. <b> Flat +1
point.</b></div>
