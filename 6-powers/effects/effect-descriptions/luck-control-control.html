<div style="padding:5px">You can use victory points (including those provided by the <a
href="../../../5-advantages.html#TOC-LUCKY">Lucky</a> advantage) to affect others in various ways (see <b>victory
points</b>). Please note that people will not dismiss this as just superstition since its usage is clearly visible
unless you apply the subtle modifier. When choosing this power choose one of the following capabilities:</div>
<ul>
<li><div style="padding:5px">You can spend a victory point on another character's behalf, with the normal benefits and
restrictions.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">You can bestow your victory point on others. You can use this only once on any given character
in a round, but the recipient may use the bestowed point(s) normally but will lose it when victory points reset (as normal).
A special victory point from Lucky must still follow the same restriction.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">You can spend one of your victory point to negate someone else's use of a victory point
(including those from the Lucky advantage) or a Gamemaster-imposed complication (at the GM's discretion). The latter
also eliminates the complication, however, so no victory points are awarded for it. Spending a special victory point in
this way can only negate the use of a victory point used to Improve Roll (even if a special one wasn't used for it).</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">You can spend a victory point (including special ones) to force someone else to reroll a dice
roll and take the worse of the two rolls. After the two sets of dice are rolled but before the results are announced the
target may spend a victory point (including special ones) to improve roll comparing the lower of the first two with the
third. For simplicity the target may instead use the victory point before rolling anything to counter this usage of Luck
Control (the target does not need the Luck Control power to do this).</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">You can spend a victory point (including special ones) to cause something normally out of your
control to happen or to randomly pick correctly among choices. For this use you must spend a victory point to get guarantee
success when the odds are 1 in 100 (1%). For each victory point spent multiply the odds by 100 (1 in 10,000 (0.01%) etc)
with a maximum of 1 in 10 billion (0.000 000 01%) with 5 victory points.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mr. Impossible, as a parlor trick, hands the
customer a deck of cards and tells him or her to shuffle it while thinking of a card, he then spends a victory point to
have the top card on the deck exactly the card they were thinking of.</div></li>
</ul>
<div style="padding:5px">There are no refunds if a spent victory point's effect is negated (via Luck Control or otherwise). If Luck Control is used to
negate the use of a victory point another victory point can be used in response which may also be countered by Luck
Control and so on causing a victory point auction off. All options except the second can in turn be negated by another's
Luck Control. As normal, <a href="nullify-attack.html">Nullify</a> can negate any of the uses of Luck Control.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters can't be compelled or controlled to use extra effort or victory points which means
that you can't be forced to use Luck Control: your luck might fail you but it will never turn against you.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Area</b>: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets in the affected area. You
spend a victory point for each subject. If you can't afford affecting each character within range then the closest ones
(the Gamemaster's choice) are affected first until no more can be affected. You must apply the same effect to all
subjects at once. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reduced Range</b>: Luck Control normally requires no attack check; if Ranged or Close range,
it does. <b>-1 cost per rank per application.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Side Effect</b>: As a particular side effect of Luck Control, if your effort to alter luck
fails, you lose another victory point (not a special one). If you do not have another normal victory point then the next
time you would receive one it is automatically taken effectively the GM gains a "free" complication against you. You
can't use Luck Control again until your debt is repaid. <b>On Failure: -1 cost per rank; Always Happens: -2 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Slower Action</b>: If the action required for Luck Control is slowed down any, it is only
usable during your turn each round, which limits its usefulness in responding to the actions of others. <b>-1 cost per
rank per application.</b></div>
</div></div>
