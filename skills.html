<h1 class="page-header-red">SKILLS</h1>
<p>Heroes sneak into the closely guarded lairs of criminal masterminds, infiltrate alien computer systems, and build
devices beyond the understanding of modern science. They can piece together obscure clues to a villain's latest plot,
run along tightropes, and pilot vehicles through obstacle courses, all in a day's work. In this game they do so through
the use of various <b>skills</b>.</p>
<h1>SKILL BASICS</h1>
<div class="right-panel red-panel">
<div>Under the Hood: Choosing Skills</div>
<div>
<p>There are a number of factors to consider when choosing skills for your character.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TRAINING-VS.-TALENT">TRAINING VS. TALENT</h3>
<p>In game terms there's no difference between a character who has ranks in a skill because of extensive training and
another whose skill ranks represent a natural talent or aptitude for the skill. Both are considered "trained" in the
skill in game terms. For example, one character might have a high <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill based
on the character's extensive training in negotiation, debate, and management. Another character's <a
href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill may stem more from personal attractiveness or a knack for getting others to
cooperate, while a third character may have a combination of the two. Feel free to decide for yourself what mix of
training and talent your character's skill ranks represent.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-LIFE-SKILLS">LIFE SKILLS</h3>
<p>When allocating skill ranks for your character consider not just the character's role as a hero but also the various
other skills the character may have picked up in day-to-day life.
Some people pick up ranks in <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, although most get by using
the skill untrained. Characters working with technology may have the <a href="#TOC-ENGINEERING">Engineering</a> skill even
if it doesn't apply to their powers. A particularly well educated person may have various
<a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a> skills. These additional skills help round out a
character and provide some background color and--who knows?--they may turn out to be useful in an adventure at some
point!</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ADVENTURING-SKILLS">ADVENTURING SKILLS</h3>
<p>Also give some thought to the skills your character needs to be effective in game play. Some are obvious, especially
if they're part of your character concept. A mechanic is likely to have ranks in <a
href="#TOC-ENGINEERING">Engineering</a>, while a doctor should have <a href="#TOC-MEDICAL">Medical</a>. Beyond the
obvious and life skills of your character consider "utility skills" like <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>,
<a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, and <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>, which many characters find useful. A few
ranks in such skills may be a smart investment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Skills are learned abilities, a combination of training (the skill) and natural talent (an ability rank). Each skill
has a rank, used as a bonus to the dice roll when using the skill. To make a skill check, roll:</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">3dF + skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers</span>
<p>The total value is limited by <a href="secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>
(power level +10). For details on each part see the sections below.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SKILL-RANK">SKILL RANK</h2>
<p>Your rank in a skill, based on the points you have invested in that skill. If you have ranks in a skill you're
considered <b>trained</b> in that skill. You can use some skills even if you don't have any ranks in them, known as
using a skill <b>untrained</b>. Some skills may not be used untrained.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ABILITY-MODIFIER">ABILITY MODIFIER</h2>
<p>Each skill has an <b>ability modifier</b> applied to the skill's checks. Each skill's ability modifier is noted in
its description and on <b>Table: Skills</b>. If you use a skill untrained, the ability modifier still applies to
the skill check.</p>
<p>The ability listed in the skill description is only for generalized use and may change based on the situation. For
example Athletics (Str) can be used for climbing (Str), knowing what a butterfly stroke is (Int), or running a marathon (Sta).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-MISCELLANEOUS-MODIFIERS">MISCELLANEOUS MODIFIERS</h2>
<p>Miscellaneous modifiers to skill checks include modifiers for circumstances, and bonuses from advantages or powers,
among others.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ACQUIRING-SKILLS">ACQUIRING SKILLS</h2>
<p>Give your hero skill ranks by spending character points: 2 skill ranks per character point. Skill ranks do not all
need to be assigned to the same skill. You can split them between different skills, thus allowing you to have two skills
with an odd number of ranks as long as the total of all skills is even. Characters can perform some tasks without any
training, using only raw talent (as defined by their ability ranks), but skilled characters are better at such things.
Having a variety of skills will allow your character to be effective at a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>You may use <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait</a> to raise a skill which would
have the same effect except that it is considered the
result of powers and not experience and thus can have modifiers and be lost during a power loss complication etc.
Another difference is that powers handle fractions differently than skills so an <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait: Skill</a>
can't split points between another and thus should always be an even number of ranks (limited by <a href="secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>).</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Skill Cost = 1 character point per 2 skill ranks.</span>
<h2 id="TOC-FINDING-THE-SKILL-YOU-WANT">FINDING THE SKILL YOU WANT</h2>
<p>If you don't find a particular skill on the list, like climbing, bluffing, or search, remember that each skill covers
a lot of ground. So, you'll find climbing isn't its own skill, but is listed as part of <a
href="#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a>, while bluffing and search are under <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> and <a
href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a>, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill you think is most
similar to what you're looking for.</p>
<h1>HOW SKILLS WORK</h1>
<p>When you use a skill, make a skill check to see how you do. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or
beat a particular number to use the skill successfully. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.
(See <b>Checks</b>, for more information.)</p>
<h2 id="TOC-UNTRAINED-SKILL-CHECKS">UNTRAINED SKILL CHECKS</h2>
<p>Generally, if you attempt a task requiring a skill you don't have, you make a skill
check as normal. Skill rank doesn't apply because you don't have any ranks in the skill. You do get other modifiers,
however, such as the skill's ability modifier.</p>
<p>Many skills can only be used if you are trained in them. Skills that cannot be used untrained are marked with a "No"
in the "Untrained" column on <b>Table: Skills</b> and listed as "Trained Only" in their descriptions. Attempts to
use these skills untrained automatically fail. In some cases, a skill may have both trained and untrained aspects; if
you do not have any ranks in that skill, you can only use the untrained parts.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-INTERACTION-SKILLS">INTERACTION SKILLS</h2>
<p>Certain skills, called <b>interaction skills</b>, are aimed at dealing with others through social interaction.
Interaction skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get them to cooperate with you in one way or
another. Since interaction skills are intended for dealing with others socially, they have certain requirements.</p>
<p>First, you must be able to interact with the subject(s) of the skill. They must be aware of you and able to understand
you. If they can't hear or understand you for some reason, you have a -2 circumstance penalty to your skill check (see
<b>Circumstance Modifiers</b> in <a href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a>).</p>
<p>Interaction skills work best on intelligent subjects, ones with an Intellect rank of -3 or better. You can use them
on creatures with less Int, but again with a -2 circumstance penalty: they're just too dumb to get the subtleties of your
point. You can't use interaction skills at all on subjects lacking one or more mental abilities such as trying to
convince a rock to be your friend or to be afraid of you.</p>
<p>You can use interaction skills on groups of subjects at once, but only to achieve the same result for everyone. So
you can attempt to use <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> or <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> to convince a
group of something, or <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> to cow a crowd, for example, but you can't convince
some individuals of one thing and the rest of another, or demoralize some and not others. The GM decides if a particular
use of an interaction skill is effective against a group, and may apply modifiers depending on the situation. The
general rules for interaction still apply: everyone in the group must be able to hear and understand you, for example,
or you suffer a -2 on your skill check against them. Mindless subjects are unaffected, as usual.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-MANIPULATION-SKILLS">MANIPULATION SKILLS</h2>
<p>Some skills, called <b>manipulation skills</b>, require a degree of fine physical manipulation. You need prehensile
limbs and a Dexterity rank or some suitable Precise power effect to use manipulation skills effectively. If your physical
manipulation capabilities are impaired in some fashion (such as having your hands tied or full use of only one hand),
the GM may impose a circumstance modifier based on the severity of the impairment. Characters lacking the ability to use
manipulation skills can still have ranks in them and use them to oversee or assist the work of others (see <b>Team
Checks</b>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TOOLS">TOOLS</h3>
<p>Some manipulation skills require tools. If tools are needed, the specific items are mentioned in the description of the
skill. If you don't have the appropriate tools, you may still be able to attempt the task, but at a major disadvantage,
for a -2 circumstance penalty on your check, if the GM decides you can attempt the task at all.</p>
<p>A character may be able to put together makeshift tools in order to make the check. If the GM allows this, reduce the
circumstance penalty to -1.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SKILL-BENCHMARKS">SKILL BENCHMARKS</h2>
<p>You can get a general idea of just how good a particular character's skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class guidelines given in <a href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a> along with the rules for routine checks (see <b>Routine
Checks</b>).</p>
<p>For example, a +5 total skill modifier means the character can routinely achieve a result of 5 (a tough task). Safe
to say the character is a pro, able to routinely handle tasks that would prove too much for someone less skilled. A
character with a +10 skill modifier achieve a DC 10 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of expertise,
while a +15 modifier can routinely complete DC 15 (formidable) tasks. At the high end, a +30 skill modifier can
routinely accomplishing the nigh impossible (DC 30 tasks)!</p>
<h1>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
<p>This section describes the skills available to characters, including their common uses and modifiers. Characters may
be able to use skills for tasks other than those given here. The GM sets the DC and decides the results in those cases.
The format for skill descriptions is given here. Items that do not apply are omitted from the skill's description.</p>

<p>Use <b>Acrobatics</b> to flip, dive, roll, tumble, and perform other acrobatic maneuvers, as well as keeping your balance
under difficult circumstances. Some things can be done untrained, see descriptions below, for all other cases it
generally can't be done untrained at the GM's discretion.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BALANCING">BALANCING</h3>
<p>This is a move action and can be done untrained. You can keep your balance and move along a precarious surface at your ground speed minus
1 rank with a successful <b>Acrobatics</b> check against the surface's DC. A degree of failure indicates you spend your move
action just maintaining your balance and do not actually move, while two or more degrees of failure means you lose your
balance and fall. This can also be used to stay standing during an earthquake, when the ship pitches to one side, or other
event that may cause falling down.</p>
<p>You are vulnerable while balancing. If you accept a +2 increase to the <b>Acrobatics</b> DC, you are not vulnerable.</p>
<p>While balancing each round or movement requires an <b>Acrobatics</b> check.
Some circumstances (such as being attacked) may also require an immediate <b>Acrobatics</b> check to stay balanced.
If you fail a resistance check while balancing, make an immediate <b>Acrobatics</b> check with a penalty equal to the
DC to of the resistance check that was failed to avoid falling. For example being affected by an <a href="powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>
5 would require an <b>Acrobatics</b> check with a penalty of 5 (on top of the normal <b>Acrobatics</b> DC).
At the end of your turn if you are still balancing
but have not yet made an <b>Acrobatics</b> check this turn then you must do so now with a +1 bonus.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-MANEUVERING">MANEUVERING</h3>
<p>This is a move action and some maneuvers can be done untrained at the GM's discretion. You can make <b>Acrobatics</b> checks for various acrobatic
stunts or maneuvers, from back flips to jumping over an opponent (to get behind them), flipping up onto a ledge,
tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneuver, while failure
means you do not, and two or more degrees of failure usually means you slip and end up prone (and may suffer additional
effects, depending on the stunt). A successful acrobatic maneuver may provide you a circumstance bonus on certain
follow-up actions, if the GM sees fit.</p>
<p>Feats of flexibility fall under this category (such as doing the splits or touching your toes) and generally have very low DC.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>This is a move action and can be done untrained. You can use <b>Acrobatics</b> to perform riding maneuvers on an animal
that has been trained for ridding. If the animal has not been trained for ridding then you must first use <a href="#TOC-CONVINCE-TO-ACT">Handle Animal: Convince to act</a>
which limits possible actions and failure may cause you to be bucked off. An animal trained for ridding will never buck
the rider (although it may disregard the safety of the rider) unless mount is afraid of the rider.</p>
<p>Failing certain attempted riding maneuvers or the mount being spooked may cause the animal to attempt to buck you off
or you may fall off on your own. In order to stay mounted you must make an <b>Acrobatics</b> check
opposed by either the animal's <b>Acrobatics</b> check (in the case of bucking) or a DC (in the
case of falling off for other reasons).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STANDING">STANDING</h3>
<p>This is a free action and can't be done untrained. You can make a DC 10 <b>Acrobatics</b> check to go from prone to standing as a free action
rather than a move action. A failed check means you remain prone and can't be attempted again this turn.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TUMBLING">TUMBLING</h3>
<p>This is a free action and can't be done untrained. You can make an <b>Acrobatics</b> check (DC -5) as a free action to lessen damage from a fall,
reducing the damage by 1 per degree of success. A fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you quickly roll to your feet.
Otherwise, you are prone at the end of a fall.</p>

</div>
<p>With a successful <b>Athletics</b> check, you can climb along a slope, wall, or other steep incline at your ground speed
rank minus 2 as a move action. A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface can't be climbed without the <a href="powers/effects/movement-movement.html#TOC-WALL-CRAWLING">Wall-crawling</a>
power.</p>
<p>Make an <b>Athletics</b> check for each movement. A failed <b>Athletics</b> check indicates you make no progress, and two or more degrees of failure means you fall from
whatever height you attained (unless you are secured with a safety harness or other equipment). You can make an <b>Athletics</b> check
to catch yourself with DC equal to the initial check + 3. Someone else within arm's reach can also make an <b>Athletics</b> check
to catch you with the same DC. If your attempt to catch someone else gets more than one degree of failure, you fall as
well.</p>
<p>Since you can't easily move to avoid attacks, you are vulnerable while climbing unless you accept a +2 increase in
the DC. If you fail a resistance check while climbing, make an immediate <b>Athletics</b> check with a penalty equal to the
DC to of the resistance check that was failed to avoid falling. For example being affected by an <a href="powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>
5 would require an <b>Athletics</b> check with a penalty of 5 (on top of the normal <b>Athletics</b> DC).</p>
<p>At the GM's discretion, certain kinds of climbing attempts might require tools like ropes, pitons, harness, and so
forth. Attempting such a climb without tools incurs a -2 circumstance penalty.
You get a bonus or penalty based on your mass rank which is 2 - your mass rank (see
<a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Action &amp; Adventure: Relative Size Rules</a>).</p>
<p>Using the same Climbing rules <b>Athletics</b> is also used to hold onto a ledge or holding onto something that is dragging
you (fall damage might not apply for this case). <b>Athletics</b> should not be used for holding onto a bucking mount
(use <a href="#TOC-RIDE-MOUNT">Acrobatics: Ride mount</a> instead) because that involves maneuvering your whole body.</p>
<p>For falling damage see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-FALLING">Action &amp; Adventure: Falling</a>.</p>

<p>The result of an <b>Athletics</b> check is the distance (in feet) you can clear in a running long-jump. If you make a
standing jump, divide the distance in half. If you make a vertical jump (straight up) divide the distance by 5, and if
you make a standing vertical jump, divide it by 10.</p>
<p>Your <b>Athletics</b> bonus is the base distance you can jump under routine circumstances. So a hero with a +20
<b>Athletics</b> bonus can make a routine long-jump of 20 feet, a standing long-jump of 10 feet, a vertical jump of 4 feet, and
a standing vertical jump of 2 feet on a routine basis.</p>
<p>You get a bonus or penalty based on your mass rank which is 2 - your mass rank (see
<a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Action &amp; Adventure: Relative Size Rules</a>)</p>
<p>If you want your hero to jump tens, hundreds, thousands of feet, or even miles, see <a
href="powers/effects/leaping-movement.html">Leaping</a> effect.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-RUNNING">RUNNING</h3>
<p>You can make a DC 5 <b>Athletics</b> (Str) check as a free action to run faster: one or more degree of success increases
your ground speed rank by +1 for one round. However doing this for more than one move action in a row is likely to
require an <b>Athletics</b> (Stamina) check in addition to <b>Athletics</b> (Strength).</p>
<p>For long distance running, a forced march, or forced labor use <b>Athletics</b> (Stamina) alone.
In the case of a forced march or forced labor if you fail your <b>Athletics</b> (Stamina) check you must make a Fortitude
defense check to avoid taking damage.</p>

<p>Each move action used to swim requires an <b>Athletics</b> check. A successful DC 0 <b>Athletics</b>
check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the check
fails, you make no progress through the water during the action. With more than one degree of failure, you go under. If
underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning (see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">Suffocation</a>).
At the end of your turn if you are still swimming but have not yet made an <b>Athletics</b> check this turn then you must do so now.</p>
<p>Swimming can't be performed untrained, however it can be performed to a lesser degree with Extra Effort (for a
Victory Point you can gain the full benefits see <b>Heroic Feat</b>). If you use Extra Effort then a DC 5 <b>Athletics</b>
(Sta) check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 3 as a standard action in order to dog paddle or tred
water.</p>

<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Fighting &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No (for most weapons)</span>
<p>You're trained with a particular type of close attack, giving you a bonus to your <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-ATTACKS">attack checks</a> with it equal to your
skill rank. Each close attack is a separate Close Combat skill with its own rank, and
encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array of <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT">Alternate effects</a>
may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster's discretion.
The bonus from a Close Combat skill applies only to attack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses,
countering, power checks, or other uses.</p>
<p>A hero might have Close Combat: Swords, but Close Combat: Melee Weapons is too broad. Close Combat: Unarmed is an
option, meaning skill with unarmed strikes like punches and kicks. This bonus also applies to other forms of
unarmed combat maneuvers such as grabbing and tripping.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common types of Close Combat: Chainsaw, Clubs, Daggers, Halberd, Improvised Weapons,
Nunchaku, Spears, Swords, Sythe, Tonfa, Unarmed, and Whip. Close Combat can be acquired for any close range attack and can't be used to
make a ranged attack check. Likewise close ranges attacks exclusively use Close Combat to make attack checks.</p>
<p>Most weapons can be used untrained but some weapons such as Whips require skill ranks in order to use.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-COMPETITION">COMPETITION (Subtype is required)</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Various &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> Yes &#8226; <b>Type</b>: Various</span>
<p>This is a catch-all skill used for all types of competition that have an objective winner such as board games, war games,
actual war (eg being a military general), baseball, and archery. This skill is not used for contests with subjective winners
(anything that requires judges to vote) such as
a beauty contest, singing contest, or gymnastics for such things see <a href="#TOC-PERFORMANCE">Performance</a> instead.
This skill can be used for single player games such as solitaire.</p>
<p>Competition is trained only because a character needs to at least know the win condition and rules to be able to play.
In the case of war a military leader needs to know how surrender and peace agreements work and what he is not allowed to
do (as imposed by his home country or international agreement).
The ability used and skill type depend on the competition chosen.
Competition has little value to H&amp;H and is included for the sake of completeness and for character background.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CONTORTION">CONTORTION</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Agility &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Full or Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You can fix your body in and out of tight places such as escaping handcuffs or squeezing between 2 objects.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SQUEEZING">SQUEEZING</h3>
<p>As a full turn action you can use Contortion to fit through a tight space
wide enough for your head but too narrow for the width of your shoulders, or to reach through an opening wide enough for
your hand, but too narrow for your arm. The base DC is 10 but may be higher depending on how tight it is. Success means you can move at your base speed -4.
Failure means you are stuck where you are (either stuck inside or can't fit in). Moving is part of this full turn action
therefore each movement requires a Contortion check.</p>
<p>You can also contort your body without objects present if you'd like to fold yourself into a smaller shape for example.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ESCAPING">ESCAPING</h3>

<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Presence &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No &#8226; <b>Type</b>: Interaction</span>
<p>Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you want them to believe. It covers things like acting,
bluffing, fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.</p>
<p>Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story. Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move action by taking a -2 penalty to your check.</p>
<p>Deception is usually opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check but may also be opposed by
Deception (Int) to recognize deceptive techniques being used.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-AVOIDING-ATTENTION">AVOIDING ATTENTION</h3>
<p>You can make a Deception check to blend into a crowd, hide guilt, or avoid suspicion. While disguise is used to prevent people
from recognizing you this use of deception is used to prevent people from noticing you. For example while playing poker
you can roll Deception to prevent others form reading your expression as easily (an opposed check against <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BLUFFING">BLUFFING</h3>
<p>Make a Deception check to tell a believable lie or get someone to go along with you. Note that believability and risk
are according to the character you are trying to deceive.</p>
<p>A bluff is opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances
weigh heavily on the outcome. Two circumstances can work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what you ask
goes against the target's self-interest, nature, or personality. Ordinary deception can only do so much, for anything
beyond this you will need the powers of either <a href="powers/effects/sample-powers/mind-control.html">Mind Control</a> or
<a href="powers/effects/mental-transform-attack.html">Mental Transform</a>. In the case of something unbelievable,
even if telling the truth people might not believe you. However if the existence of super powers
is well known then there are many circumstances that might not seem so unbelievable.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The sorcerer Tim leads a group of knights to
a cave guarded by a terrible monster who has slain dozens of knights. Upon arrival Tim points to an ordinary looking bunny
and tells them that it is the monster. Despite being the truth the knights refuse to believe it, charge in, fight a hopeless
battle losing several men, and retreat. Maybe if Tim explained that the bunny was not ordinary the knights would have considered it.</p>
<p>If it's important, you can distinguish between a deception that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the target gets a +4 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands some kind of risk, and the resistance check succeeds by 4 or less, then the target doesn't so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check succeeds
by 5 or more, he has seen through the deception, and would have refused even if it had not placed unusual demands on
him (that is, even without the +4 modifier).</p>
<p>You can also use Bluffing to trick people into giving you money, goods, and services. The fraud may involve multiple people,
bad investments, snake oil, or false promises.</p>

<p>You can use Deception to send covert messages using word-play and double-meanings while apparently talking about
other things. The DC for a basic message is 0. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new information have
DCs of 5 or 10, respectively. The recipient of the message must make a <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check against
the same DC to understand it.</p>
<p>Anyone listening in on your innuendo can attempt an <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check against the message DC. If successful, the
eavesdropper notices that there is a message hidden in your conversation. If the eavesdropper gets at least two degrees of success, he
also understands the message. Whether trying to send or pick up on a message, more than one degree of failure on the
check means the receiver misinterprets the message in some fashion.</p>
<p>To use another language entirely see the <a href="advantages.html#TOC-LANGUAGES">Languages advantage</a> for ciphers and
encryption use <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DISGUISE">DISGUISE</h3>
<p>You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance. Your Deception check result determines the
effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others' <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly so
you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Disguise is heavily dependent on circumstances: favorable ones include appropriate costuming and a subject resembling
your normal appearance, while unfavorable circumstances include disguising yourself as a member of a different race or
sex, or not having sufficient props (which can be up to a -2 modifier). If you are impersonating a particular
individual, anyone who knows that individual gets a circumstance bonus to the <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
check: regular associates get a +1, while friends get a +2 and intimate loved ones a +4. Note that the observer is limited
by his <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a> of the real person and therefore someone highly observant won't see through
your disguise if he doesn't know better.</p>
<p>Disguise is limited by both available resources and knowledge of intended appearance. These factors act as maximums to
your disguise result. Therefore without performing a <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a> check your disguise can only
be so good no matter how high the Deception: disguise total could be. However you generally know what you are trying to look
like and so a secondary roll is rarely necessary.</p>
<p>Successfully acting like who you appear to be may also require a Deception check with a DC equal to the observer's <a
href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check, modified by familiarity if the observer knows the subject well, as mentioned
previously.</p>
<p>A disguise normally requires at least 10 minutes of preparation. The GM makes <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> checks for those who
encounter you immediately upon meeting you and each hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DISTRACTION">DISTRACTION</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to cause a distraction, hold someone's attention, or drown out a sound. You can distract either a
group or an individual opposed by either <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> to realize that this is a distraction or
<a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> to notice what is being hidden.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FEINTING">FEINTING</h3>
<p>You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a standard
action opposed by your target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>. If your Deception check succeeds, the target is
vulnerable against your next attack until the end of your next turn (see <b>Vulnerable</b> <a href="the-basics/conditions.html">condition</a>).</p>
<p>Not to be confused with fainting, although playing dead is a possible deception for which you'll need to fall prone regardless
of your check and need to stay that way for a round.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FORGERY">FORGERY</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to make a counterfeit document item. Your Deception check result determines the
effectiveness of the forgery, opposed by others' <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly so
you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Forgery uses some of the same rules as <a href="#TOC-DISGUISE">Disguise</a> in that it is heavily dependent on circumstances,
is limited by your available resources, is limited by your knowledge of the original, and the observer is limited by his knowledge
of the original.</p>
<p>You will likely need to also roll <a href="#TOC-BLUFFING">bluff</a> when presenting the item in order to convince people
that it is genuine.</p>
<p>A forgery normally requires at least 10 minutes of preparation.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-TRICKING">TRICKING</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action, such as trying to hit you while
standing in front of an electrical junction box or at the edge of a precipice. If your Deception check opposed by
<a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> succeeds, your opponent is heedless of the potential danger and may hit the junction box
or lose his balance and fall, if his attack against you fails. (On the other hand, if the attack succeeds, it might slam
you into the junction box or send you flying off the edge. You're taking a risk.)</p>
<p>More than one degree of failure on the Deception check means you put yourself in a bad position; you are vulnerable
against the target's attacks for 1 round!</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ENGINEERING">ENGINEERING (Subtype is required)</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Mostly Dexterity or Presence &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Mostly Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> Mostly &#8226;
<b>Type</b>: Manipulation with required tools (where applicable)</span>
<p><b>Engineering</b> covers operating, building, repairing, and generally working with a certain kind of technological
devices. Examples of engineering subtypes are: clockwork, mechanical, electronic, steampunk, magical, and psychic.
Without the proper tools or equipment, you take a -2 penalty to <b>Engineering</b> checks for highly unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p><a href="#TOC-DIAGNOSE">Diagnose</a> using Intellect, <a href="#TOC-INVENTING">Inventing</a> using Intellect, <a href="#TOC-SET-UP">Set up</a> uses Dexterity,
<a href="#TOC-DEMOLITION">Demolitions</a> uses Intellect and the rest use either Dexterity or Intellect depending on the
<b>Engineering</b> subtype. Most subtypes use Dexterity as the main ability however those that focus on force of personality rather
than hand eye coordination (for example: psychic) would use Presence instead.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DIAGNOSE">DIAGNOSE</h3>
<p>You can analyze what a system is doing or what is wrong with it. This <b>Engineering</b> check uses Intellect and takes
at least a minute. This will allow you to determine what an unknown spell does or what's wrong with a machine.
This does not need to be done before you can disable a device or do anything else with it therefore this application has
very limited usefulness.</p>
<p>An <b>Engineering</b> check can also be used to identify a device using Intellect but since that's a <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">knowledge</a> check
it is a free action and can only be used to recognize known devices (such as an electric can opener) rather than figure
out the purpose of a custom made or unusual device.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-INVENTING">INVENTING</h3>
<p>This <b>Engineering</b> check uses Intellect to create inventions, temporary devices.
The DC is equal to the invention's total Character point cost +5. If <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-REMOVABLE">removable</a>
is applied it does not reduce the point cost,
as inventions are temporary by nature. Inventions are subject to the same <a href="secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limits</a>
as other effects in the series.</p>
<p>The time it takes to create a device is time rank = (point cost - 5)*2/5 + 10 rounded up.
You can reduce the rank of the design time, by increasing the DC by 2 for each -1 time rank reduction.
Alternatively you can perform a <a href="the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">power stunt</a> in order to gain
10 ranks of <a href="powers/effects/quickness-general.html">Quickness</a> which will reduce the time rank by 10.</p>
<p>Success means the invention is complete and functional. Failure means the invention doesn't
work. Three or more degrees of failure may result in a mishap, at the GM's discretion.
Exactly what the mishap is depends heavily on the invention.
Invention mishaps can become a source of adventure ideas and put the heroes in some difficult situations.
They may also be setbacks, suitable for Victory point awards.</p>
<p>Once the invention is complete, it is good for use in one scene, after which it breaks down or
runs out of power. If the character wishes to use the invention again, there are two options.
The first is to spend the necessary Character points to acquire the invention as a regular
power, part of the character's traits; in this case, the device will receive the normal point reduction for <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-REMOVABLE">removable</a>
and will be kept like any other power.
The other option is to spend a Victory point to get another one-scene use out of the invention.
Each use costs an additional Victory point, but doesn't require any further skill checks.</p>
<p>Although it's possible to prepare certain one-use devices in advance, the GM should require the
player to spend a Victory point to have a particular previously constructed invention conveniently on-hand during an
adventure.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: Mr. Science needs to whip up a mind-shielding
device to confront the evil Mastermind, who has seized control of his teammates. 5 ranks of <a href="powers/effects/resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a>
to Mental Effects cost 15 Character points, so the <b>Engineering</b> check is DC 20 and would take time rank 16 (4 days).
Mr. Science's skill bonus is +20, so he succeeds with a routine check. However he doesn't have days to spare since Mastermind
plans to send his new "puppets" into action in a few hours. In order to speed things up Mr. Science uses a <a href="the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">power stunt</a>
in order to gain <a href="powers/effects/quickness-general.html">Quickness</a> 10 and is able to create the device in
time rank 6 (6 minutes). Now he has a makeshift mind-shield that hopefully will
protect him long enough to try and free his teammates from the villain's influence.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BUILDING">BUILDING</h3>
<p>The difficulty and time required to make an item depends on its complexity, as shown on the <b>Building Items</b>
table. If your <b>Engineering</b> check succeeds, you have made the item after the necessary time. If the check fails,
you did not produce a usable end result, although the materials may be reusable. More than one degree of failure on the
check may produce material loss, an accident, or other unfortunate side-effect at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>You may also upgrade or improve a device using the same rules based on the complexity of the change being made.</p>
<p>Notice that the default time rank = (base DC-5)*2/5 + 10. Note that this time is assuming a single person working
continuously, if work is done at a rate of 8 hours per day then simply add 1 to the time rank.
You can reduce the time rank to build or upgrade an item by 1 by increasing the DC by 5.</p>

<p>You can use <b>Engineering</b> to set up, install, or place devices. This can be used to lay a trap, place explosives,
install surveillance cameras, or install a high voltage outlet. Failure means that nothing happens and you may try again.
More than one degree of failure on the check may damage the device, cause an accident, or other unfortunate side-effect
at the GM's discretion. For traps and explosives a mishap may prove deadly!</p>
<p>This <b>Engineering</b> check uses Dexterity and has an action of Standard, full round, or slow depending on the complexity.
For simple cases (such as setting a mouse trap) no training is required. Tools may or may not be required.</p>
<p>You can choose to make the device harder to notice, appear as if it hasn't been changed, or harder to disable at the

<p>This is a standard action and doesn't require tools. For equipment that is intended to be operated by the public, most
routine operations won't require a skill
check (because a routine check is sufficient) and can be done untrained. Using an unfamiliar device does require a check,
with the DC determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from simple (DC 0) to highly advanced (DC 15 or more).</p>
<p>This includes the operation of vehicles, from ground vehicles like cars to boats, planes, or even spaceships! See
<a href="gadgets-gear/vehicles.html">Vehicles in Gadgets &amp; Gear</a> for details.</p>
<p>Operating vehicles is a likely operation that will be necessary in a stressful or dramatic situation like being chased
or attacked or trying to reach a destination in a limited amount of time. Additionally there are more advanced driving maneuvers
such that a routine check may not be sufficient:</p>
<p>For riding an animal see <a href="#TOC-RIDE-MOUNT">Acrobatics: Ride mount</a> instead.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-REPAIRING">REPAIRING</h3>
<p>You can also use <b>Engineering</b> to repair damaged items, using the <a href="#TOC-BUILDING">building rules</a> with
a -5 to the DC to build the item and -2 to the time rank
required depending on how badly damaged the object is. So you can perform repairs on a complex item in eight hours
(time rank 12) with a DC of 10. Failure on the
check means you spend the time, but make no progress. Two or more degrees of failure may indicate further damage to the
item or an accident similar to building it.</p>
<p>You can reduce the time rank to repair an item by 1 by increasing the DC by 5.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-JURY-RIGGING">JURY-RIGGING</h3>
<p>You can also attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. This uses the same rules for <a href="#TOC-REPAIRING">repairing</a>

<p>You can use an <b>Engineering</b> check to disarm an explosive, disarm a trap, unlock a lock, or disable any other device.
This can be done untrained for simple cases (such as removing batteries).
The device is in no way harmed it is simply rendered inoperational such as by turning it off, unplugging, or very basic disassembly.
The device may be used again (see <a href="#TOC-SET-UP">Set up</a>) which is useful if you'd like to use the same trap on
someone else.</p>
<p>If you fail the disable check, nothing happens and the device still functions. With more than
a degree of failure, the trap or explosive may go off but for most other devices nothing happens (eg an inmate remains incarcerated).</p>
<p>The DCs listed for prisons are for the inmate to escape, the DC for an outside force breaking someone out might be
different depending on circumstances. Super-max security (aka a super-prison) is a maximum security prison that is specifically
designed to account for the powers of the inmates. This can be done through <a href="powers/effects/nullify-attack.html">power negation</a>,

<p>Alternatively you can sabotage a device so that it falls apart or destroys itself upon next use so that it appears to
remain functional. Sabotage only applies to traps and devices that can be operated (it doesn't apply for locks and prisons).
Simple cases can be done untrained but sabotage isn't simple.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEMOLITION">DEMOLITION</h3>
<p>Careful placement of explosives (or other weapons) against a structure can maximize damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
structure. This requires at least a minute and a DC 0 <b>Engineering</b> check that uses Intellect. For every degree of success, the structure takes
a -1 toughness penalty. Failure means the explosive does not go off as planned, while more than one degree of
failure means the charge goes off while you are setting it! In all cases, the explosive deals normal damage to all other
targets.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-HANDLE-ANIMAL">HANDLE ANIMAL</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Presence &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard or Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b>
Teach a trick is trained only &#8226; <b>Type</b>: None (but similar to Interaction)</span>
<p>You're skilled at dealing with animals. You can train them, convince them to act, or simply care for them. This is similar to <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a>
except that <b>Handle Animal</b> only works on animals whereas <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> only works on people.</p>
<p>You can only use <a href="#TOC-CONVINCE-TO-ACT">Convince to act</a> and <a href="#TOC-TEACH-A-TRICK">teach a trick</a>
on a single animal at a time but <a href="#TOC-CARE-FOR">care for</a> and <a href="#TOC-SCARE-OR-CALM-DOWN">scare or calm down</a>
can be done on groups of animals.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CONVINCE-TO-ACT">CONVINCE TO ACT</h3>
<p>As a standard action you can use <b>Handle Animal</b> to make an animal do something that it hasn't been trained for.
The action must be simple such as retrieving and object, attacking a target, digging, coming to you, etc. The animal must
be smart enough to figure out your intention and must be reasonably capable of doing the task (eg you can't tell a hawk
to dig). The base DC is 15.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TEACH-A-TRICK">TEACH A TRICK</h3>
<p>This can't be done untrained. You can teach a tame animal a trick so that it can perform the action on demand. This is a slow action since it involves
having the animal repeat the action over a long period (at least time rank 17 which is a week) of time giving out reward and punishment as needed.
The trick can be more complex than <a href="#TOC-CONVINCE-TO-ACT">Convince to act</a> since time can be spent teaching each
step but it must still be relatively simple and the animal must still be reasonable capable both mentally and physically.
There is no hard limit on the number of things an animal can learn but the Gamemaster should consider the animal's intellect
and the complexity of the tricks when deciding if an animal is mentally capable of learning more.</p>
<p>Once the animal learns the trick anyone can ask the animal to perform it (given they know the trigger word or gesture)
without needing to make a check. An animal that knows tricks is easier to <a href="#TOC-CONVINCE-TO-ACT">Convince to act</a>
by using the animal's name and familiar gestures/words.</p>
<p>In addition to actions an animal can learn certain words (the animal's name, the word "no", the word "ball", etc),
can be potty trained, and can learn certain attitudes such as staying close to a human or ignoring certain people.</p>
<p>Over an even longer period of time (at least a year which is time rank 23) an animal can be trained with a theme in mind.
This is really just a simplification of teaching an animal many tricks. Generally an animal can have only 1 general purpose.
Some example purposes are: racing, being ridden, being ridden in combat, fighting in combat, guarding, heavy labor, pulling
carts or plows, hunting, rescuing, guiding the blind, rounding up livestock, and entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CARE-FOR">CARE FOR</h3>
<p>Being good with animals also means the ability to take care of an animal (including babies). As a slow action you can
groom, wash, clean up after, feed, and make sure that the animal is comfortable. These actions generally don't require
a check as long as you know what to do. Knowing what is needed is, of course, a <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">knowledge</a> check
that uses intellect and is a free action.</p>
<p>With the right facility it is possible to care for an animal without taming it conversely steps can be taken to adjust the animal
to humans. An animal must be tame before you can <a href="#TOC-TEACH-A-TRICK">teach a trick</a> additionally everything else
becomes easier.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SCARE-OR-CALM-DOWN">SCARE OR CALM DOWN</h3>
<p>As a standard action you can use <b>Handle Animal</b> to either cause or relieve fear in an animal. Scaring an animal
can be used to cause a bear to run away rather than attack you, for example. Animals are naturally spooked by storms and
combat but special training can make them difficult to scare.</p>
<p>While you could in theory use <b>Handle Animal</b> for other emotions, animals are not smart enough to understand such
complex communication (also animal emotions are more simple than human emotions).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-INSIGHT">INSIGHT</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Awareness &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No &#8226; <b>Type</b>: Interaction (where applicable)</span>
<p>You can tell someone's true intentions and feelings by paying attention to things like body language, inflection, and
your own intuition. A successful Insight check allows you to resist the effects of some interaction skills, becoming aware of the other
person's true intent. You can also use the skill to tell when someone is behaving oddly or for assessing
trustworthiness.</p>
<p>All <b>Insight</b> checks are secret checks since what the character thinks is going on may be completely wrong.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DECIPHER-HIDDEN-MESSAGE">DECIPHER HIDDEN MESSAGE</h3>
<p>You can use Insight to pick up on hidden messages sent via the <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> skill.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETECT-ILLUSION">DETECT ILLUSION</h3>
<p>The GM makes a secret Insight check to determine if your hero senses the true nature of an illusion (DC = Illusion
rank). Success means you pick up on a flaw in the illusion, sensing it is not real which allows a Will defense check to overcome it.
Insight itself can't be used to overcome an illusion. See <a href="powers/effects/illusion-control.html">Illusion</a> effect for details.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETECT-INFLUENCE">DETECT INFLUENCE</h3>
<p>You can make a Insight check to notice someone acting under outside influence. The DC is equal to the rank of the effect
or skill affecting the subject. If you succeed, you notice the subject is not acting entirely of his or her own will.
Three or more degrees give you a general idea of what is influencing them (and perhaps even whom, depending on the
situation and the Gamemaster's judgment).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETECT-PERSUASION">DETECT PERSUASION</h3>
<p>You can make a Insight check to notice that someone is trying to <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuade</a> you using common techniques
such as flattery, yelling, black mail, making suggestive motions, etc. While the person is not lying a successful <b>Insight</b>
check will allow you to make decisions with a clear mind, resisting the influence of <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuade</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETERMINE-ATTITUDE">DETERMINE ATTITUDE</h3>
<p>With an Insight check, opposed by <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>, you can tell if someone is trustworthy and
honorable (or not) upon meeting them. You can also make an Insight check (DC 10) to evaluate a social situation, getting
a feel for the overall mood and prevailing attitudes. Two or more degrees of failure on either check mean you
misinterpret the signs, so the GM may make these checks for you in secret.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DISCERN-DECEPTION">DISCERN DECEPTION</h3>
<p>Make an Insight check when called to do so to see through the effects of <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>.
If the result of your check exceeds your opponent's, you know that the person is being deceptive and depending on the
circumstances you may even be able to discern what the truth actually is.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-INVESTIGATION">INVESTIGATION</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Intellect &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You know how to search for and study clues, gather information through interviews and surveillance, and analyze
evidence to help solve crimes. The GM may make investigation checks for you in secret, so you do not know exactly what
you have found, or if you may have missed something.</p>

<p>You know how to make contacts, collect gossip and rumors, question informants, obtain surveillance footage, and otherwise
get information from people or other recorded sources (for gathering evidence see <a href="#TOC-ANALYZE-EVIDENCE">Analyze

<p>By succeeding at a DC 0 Investigation check taking at least an hour, you get a feel for the major news and rumors in
an area. This assumes no obvious reasons exist why information would be withheld. The degree of the check result
determines the completeness and detail of the information. Information ranges from general to protected, and the DC
increases accordingly for the type of information, as given on the table.</p>
<p>General information concerns local happenings, rumors, gossip, and the like.</p>
<p>Specific information usually relates to a particular question.</p>

<p>Protected information is even harder to come by and might involve some danger, either for the one asking the

</div>
<p>You can search an area for clues, hidden items, traps, and other details. <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
allows you to immediately notice things, while an Investigation check allows you to pick up on details with some
effort.</p>
<p>To determine how long it takes to search a given area, take the total area measurement (in square feet, yards, or
miles), find the time measurement for that distance, and add 2. So searching 60 square feet (roughly an 8 ft. by 8 ft.
room) takes the time rank of 60 feet (rank 1), plus 2, or 1 minute (time rank 3). Searching a square mile takes the time
rank of 1 mile (rank 8), plus 2, or two hours (time rank 10).</p>
<p>The DC for an Investigation check to find a concealed object is opposed by a <a href="#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a>
check if the object is hidden during the search such as stealing a small object. Otherwise Investigation is opposed
by <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> of the character who hid it. For objects that weren't intentionally hidden the DC
is determined by the Gamemaster.</p>
<p>Searching an area will have a DC that depends on your size see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Action &amp; Adventure: Relative Size Rules</a>

<h2 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-KNOWLEDGE">KNOWLEDGE (Subtype is required)</h2>

<div>Under the Hood: Character Knowledge vs. Player Expertise</div>
<div>
<p>Knowledge skills measure what your character knows about various things, whether you know anything about them or not.
It's fairly easy to measure what a hero knows by making the appropriate skill check or looking at the routine check
value (which is equal to the total bonus).</p>
<p>However, players may know things their characters do not, either because of the player's life experience or knowledge
of the game and its rules (and source material). In this case the Gamemaster may prefer players limit themselves to only
what Knowledge skills their heroes have rather than what they may or may not know about a given situation. The GM may
bend this rule by allowing a player to spend a victory point to have a character act upon something he or she would have
no way of knowing, calling it a "hunch" or a "lucky guess" (a version of the inspiration rule). See <b>victory
points</b>.</p>
<p>If there's a question as to how to handle an issue of player versus character expertise in the game, consult your
Gamemaster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Knowledge is a broad skill encompassing a variety of specialized fields. Each is considered a separate skill and
knowledge in each is acquired separately, so a person might have Knowledge: Nature and Knowledge: Electronics, each with
their own ranks, for example.</p>
<p>If the DC is 0 or less then it can be done untrained (DC 1 or more requires skill ranks). This represents common knowledge
or common sense, things that can easily be picked up without training.</p>
<p>Not all knowledge can be obtained from knowledge rolls. Any knowledge that isn't spread or that your character couldn't
have heard can't be obtained by a knowledge check. For example you can't roll Knowledge: Criminal to learn
the combination to a personal safe if there was no way for that combination to have been spread. You also can't roll
Knowledge: History to learn about past events of a planet you've never heard of. Also see the <a href="powers/effects/attain-knowledge-general.html">Attain Knowledge</a> power.</p>
<p>Knowledge checks can't use any other ability and therefore Knowledge ranks can at best provide a circumstance bonus when
attempting the application of the Knowledge. However every other skill can be used as an appropriate Knowledge check by using Intelligence as
the ability. For example Athletics (Str) can be used as Knowledge: Swimming (Int) to answer
the question "what is a butterfly stroke?" but on the other hand Knowledge: Swimming (Int) can't be used as Athletics
(Str). For another example Knowledge: Investigation can represent experience in the field and thus a successful roll can name
the best places to start looking for evidence providing a +1 bonus to the following
<a href="#TOC-ANALYZE-EVIDENCE">Investigation: Analyze Evidence</a> check.</p>
<p>The reason why a character would put ranks in Knowledge instead of (or in addition to) another skill is for role
playing reasons (such as a student who knows more than he can apply) and because some knowledge doesn't have an application
skill.</p>
<p>All other skills can have a Knowledge equivalent. The following are other examples of suitable
areas of Knowledge. This list is by no means exhaustive, the GM should feel free to add to or modify this list as needed
to suit the game and the characters in it.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Appraise</b>: You can determine the value of goods and services. A failed skill check means you don't
know the value, the Gamemaster may (or may not) provide a false value depending on the situation. This skill can be used
to determine the value both locally and elsewhere such as a caravan knowing the value of silk in both China and Egypt.
This skill can be used to appraise illegal goods and services and for knowing currency exchange rates.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Criminal</b>: In addition to knowing some common techniques of committing crimes you may also know where
to find criminals and how to locate a black market.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Dimensions</b>: You know what other dimensions exist and what they contain (creatures, landscapes etc).
If the physics is different or time travels differently you can roll this knowledge to see if you know about it.
Knowledge: Dimensions should only be used for common knowledge about and within dimensions and should not be used to determine
specifics. For example you can use Knowledge: Dimensions to know that there's another dimension filled with water that contains
mermaids and other aquatic life but if you'd like to know if a specific fish in said dimension is poisonous then you'll need to
roll a <a href="#TOC-SURVIVAL">Survival</a> skill check. This skill is especially useful if you can travel between dimensions
(see <a href="powers/effects/movement-movement.html#TOC-DIMENSION-TRAVEL">movement power</a>).
This knowledge is highly dependent on the setting of the game so ask your Gamemaster before taking this skill if other dimensions
exist or if they matter.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: History</b>: While history is generally just academic it may prove useful to know about past events such as
when <a href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigating</a>. This skill is especially useful to time travelers assuming history hasn't
changed.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Law</b>: knowing the law well is useful to those who are trying to evade and those trying to convict.
This can be used for laws of all sizes: local, national, global, or larger.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Linguistics</b>: The study of language. This can be used to identify hand writing although this can also be done
by <a href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation (Analyze Evidence)</a>. This skill can be used to translate a language you
don't know (although this is very difficult and requires a lot of time and resources). Also see the <a href="advantages.html#TOC-LANGUAGES">Languages advantage</a>.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Religion</b>: You know the lore of various religions such as the names of gods and goddesses and the stories
involved. You also know the religious laws, traditions, holy symbols, and practical applications. This knowledge is especially
useful to those who directly interact with spiritual forces such as a demon hunter.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Trivia</b>: A collection of random facts that are commonly used in trivia contests. None of them should
be obvious and few of them useful.</p>
<p>Other examples include: Astronomy, Business, Culture, Current Events, Dungeoneering, Geography, Magic, Military, Music,
Nobility, Philosophy, Politics, Science, Sociology, and Streetwise.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-EXAMINATION">EXAMINATION</h3>
<p>You can diagnose injuries and ailments at DC 0. This takes at least a minute. Tools (such as a stethoscope or thermometer)
are not required but provide a +1 circumstance bonus. Diagnosing yourself only incurs a -2 circumstance penalty if you can't
effectively inspect a required area. At the GM's discretion, a successful diagnosis provides a +1 bonus for favorable
circumstances on Medical checks to treat it.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-PROVIDE-CARE">PROVIDE CARE</h3>
<p>Providing care means treating an injured patient for an hour or more at DC 5. If successful, the patient doubles recovery rate
(see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RECOVERY">Recovery</a>). You can
provide care for a number of patients (including yourself) up to your Medical rank at one time. Tools may be required depending
on the ailment such as ice packs or splints, failing to have the required tools incurs a -2 circumstance penalty.
You take a -2 circumstance penalty on the Medical check to treat yourself.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STABILIZE">STABILIZE</h3>
<p>As a standard action, a successful DC 5 Medical check stabilizes a dying character. This may require tools such as bandages,
failing to have the required tools incurs a -2 circumstance penalty.
This can't be done on yourself since you won't be able to take the standard action required.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TORTURE">TORTURE</h3>
<p>You can use your Medical knowledge to inflict pain while keeping the victim alive. This is simply noting an application
of a Medical check rather than a different kind of roll. To actually do this you would roll <a href="#TOC-EXAMINATION">Examination</a>,
<a href="#TOC-STABILIZE">Stabilize</a>, and Medical knowledge (see <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a>) as needed.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TREAT-AFFLICTION">TREAT AFFLICTION</h3>
<p>As a standard action you can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison. The next time this round that the patient
makes a resistance check against the ailment, you make a Medical check at DC 5. 1 or 2 degrees of success provides the patient with a +1 circumstance
bonus to the resistance check, 3 or more degrees of success provides a +2 circumstance bonus. Only a single Medical check can be done
per affliction resistance check, if multiple exist only the highest rank applies. Unlike normal <a href="the-basics/index.html#TOC-TEAM-CHECKS">team checks</a>
failing will not provide a penalty. This can be done on yourself at no penalty. The tools required are medicine or antivenom etc
and can't be performed without tools.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PERCEPTION">PERCEPTION</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Awareness &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>Use this skill to perceive things with your senses. Discerning details--such as clearly hearing conversation or reading
fine text--requires at least 1 degree of success on the Perception check.</p>
<p>In general, you have a -1 circumstance penalty to Perception checks for every 15 feet between you and what you
are trying to perceive. So hearing a noise from 60 feet away is a -4 modifier to your Perception check, for example.
While you're asleep you are visually unaware and
most senses take a -5 perception penalty in order to wake up, see <a href="the-basics/conditions.html">conditions</a> for
more information on sleep.</p>
<p>The GM usually makes Perception checks secretly so you don't know whether there was nothing to notice or you simply
failed to notice it. You automatically get a Perception check every time you have the opportunity to notice something new. You
may also make a Perception check once per round to attempt to notice something you failed (or believe you failed) to notice
previously.</p>
<p>Note that <b>Perception</b> may be used indirectly through another source. Such as someone in a security office watching
all of the surveillance screens at once or a witch using a crystal ball (see <a href="powers/effects/remote-sensing-sensory.html">Remote Sensing</a>).</p>

<h3 id="TOC-HEARING">HEARING</h3>
<p>Make a check against a DC based on how loud the noise is or against an opposed <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>
check. A very loud noise such as a gun shot is DC -30, a loud noise such as metal striking metal is DC -20,
normal conversation or unarmed combat is DC -10, a soft noise DC 0, a whisper is DC 10. The DC gets a +2 per inch of material that is in the way such
as a door or solid wall in addition to the -1 per 15 ft distance penalty.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SEEING">SEEING</h3>
<p>Make a check against a DC based on how visible the object is or against an opposed <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>
check. Noticing something that stands out (because of size, color, or location for examples) is DC -10,
something in plain sight but ordinary is DC 0, something small or subtle is DC 10. Discerning details requires at least
1 degree of success, as usual.</p>
<p>Visual perception is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the <b><a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a></b> skill) or
to notice a concealed object (see the <b><a href="#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a></b> skill).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-OTHER-SENSES">OTHER SENSES</h3>

<h3 id="TOC-FOLLOW-TRAIL">FOLLOW TRAIL</h3>
<p>You can follow trails and track using your <a href="powers/effects/senses-sensory.html#TOC-ACUTE">acute senses</a> (only
Visual and auditory sense types are acute by default). You can move
once per turn at your base speed or for a -2 circumstance penalty you can move twice per turn.
If you are tracking a living being in an atmosphere then smell (Olfactory) is the only non-exotic type trail directly left
behind and it has a base DC of 0. Foot prints can also be left behind directly under certain
circumstances, such as snow or mud, however doubling back will raise the DC. A faint trail or a trail that's been interfered with
has a higher DC. Trails will naturally fade over time with a speed dependent on the weather.</p>

<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Presence &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No &#8226;
<b>Type</b>: Interaction</span>
<p>You're skilled in dealing with people, from etiquette and social graces to a way with words and public speaking, all
of which helps to get your point across, make a good impression, negotiate, and generally win people over to your way of
seeing things. However you can also use this skill as a weapon to demoralize, antagonize, or coerce.</p>
<p>Non-player characters each have an initial attitude towards you or your cause. The GM chooses the character's initial
attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a specific
circumstance or complication may call for a different attitude. Attitude may also change over time. Additionally the average person
is rarely, if ever, hostile since most people have some kind of moral or social standard.</p>

</table>
<p>Persuasion can be performed on an individual or a group. If your target is a group make a single check. The GM uses the highest
applicable DC or makes a single opposed roll using the highest trait in order to represent the entire group.
Your Persuasion check must have the same effect on every member of the group (that is, you can't demoralize some and coerce
others, for example).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CHANGE-ATTITUDE">CHANGE ATTITUDE</h3>
<p>You can improve others' attitudes with a DC 5 Persuasion check. Success improves the subject's attitude by 1 step,
while every 2 additional degrees of success improve it by another 1 step (so 2 steps at 3 degrees, 3 steps at
5 degrees, and so forth). Failure means no change, and more than a degree of failure worsens the subject's attitude
by one (and only 1) step! In the case of a hostile subject, they may outright attack or otherwise interfere with you if their
attitude worsens.</p>
<p>You can also choose to worsen others' attitudes. The check is the same as improving attitude except that success makes
the attitude worsen by steps based on degree of success and that failure of any degree will not change attitude.</p>
<p>Changing attitude is at least a standard action, usually quite a bit longer. The GM decides if you can persuade at
all once a conflict has broken out! Even if the initial check succeeds, the subject can only be persuaded so
far; you can try again in the same scene, but you check against the subject's initial attitude, and may end up worsening
it rather than improving it!</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The heroes must convince the imperious King
of Atlantis that the surface world is not responsible for recent attacks against his kingdom in order to avert a war. The
king's attitude is unfavorable towards these surface-world interlopers to begin with. The team's spokesperson makes a
Persuasion attempt and gets a check result of 9, a success with two degrees total. That shifts the king's attitude one
step, to indifferent. He's inclined to continue negotiating with the heroes and willing to place the assault on the surface
world on-hold for the time-being. The heroes try to convince the king further, but any additional checks need at least the
same degree of success as the first to get his attitude to favorable, where he is willing to call off the attack, and more
than one degree of failure on any check moves his attitude to hostile, where he orders the intruders arrested and the
attack to begin at once!</p>
<p>If a Persuasion check fails, trying again is futile; the subject is too set against your arguments. At the GM's
discretion, you can try again when the situation changes in some way: you find a new approach to your argument, new
evidence appears, and so forth. The GM may consider you at a disadvantage in further negotiations, imposing a
circumstance penalty as well.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CHANGE-MOOD">CHANGE MOOD</h3>
<p>You can manipulate mood and emotion such as inspire, scare, anger, seduce, or confuse. The affects of which are
situational for example you can confuse to prevent an agreement, hide a bluff, or provoke an attack. The method used to
change mood is also various and can be fast talking, using big words, reciting a poem, or using body language.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> you can't force people to act, you can only
impair judgement.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CONVINCE">CONVINCE</h3>
<p>As a slow action you can convince a person or group of something. This does not change attitude and is used to
explain why a story is true or false or explain why an idea or action is better or worse.</p>
<p>If you are not opposed the DC is based on the average attitude of the audience. Hostile is DC 10, Unfavorable is DC 5,
Indifferent is DC 0, Favorable is DC -5, and Helpful is DC -10. With circumstance bonus or penalty based on how hard it is to
believe you and how complex your idea is.</p>
<p>In negotiations or debates, make an opposed roll with the average attitude of the audience towards you acting as a bonus
or penalty: Hostile is -10, Unfavorable is -5, Indifferent is +0, Favorable is +5, and Helpful is +10. Whoever gets the highest
total wins. Therefore if the audience has a better attitude towards your opponent than towards you then your opponent is
more likely to win.</p>
<p>If your claim is untrue then you must also pass a <a href="#TOC-BLUFFING">Deception: Bluff</a> check in order to successfully
convince. Winning the convince but failing bluff will leave the audience unsure what to believe.</p>
<p>While you are convincing you may also roll a Persuasion check to coerce your audience or change their attitude.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: Golden Boy runs to warn the mayor about an incoming alien invasion however
the villain Fear Monger follows. Golden Boy tries to convince the mayor to evacuate the city but Fear Monger claims that
there is no alien invasion. The mayor's attitude towards the hero Golden Boy is favorable but he is unfavorable towards
Fear Monger. Fear Monger (doing what he does best) rolls to coerce the mayor, his check succeeds so the mayor is considered favorable
during this conversation. Fear Monger then rolls Persuasion to convince the mayor getting a total of 17 while Golden Boy rolls
a total of 9. Since the mayor is favorable to both of them they both get a +5 (already factored in). Fear Monger has the higher
total but since he is lying he must also roll <a href="#TOC-BLUFFING">Deception</a>.
He rolls a total of 10 and the mayor gets a total of 3 including his -2 penalty because he wants to believe that there is no
impending alien invasion. The poor mayor is convinced that there is no danger and Golden Boy frowns knowing that he'll
have to save the city some other way.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-COERCING">COERCING</h3>
<p>You know how to use threats (both real and implied) to get others to do what you want. As a standard action make a Persuasion
check, opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> or Will defense (whichever has the highest bonus). If
your check succeeds, you may treat the target as favorable, but only for actions taken in your presence. That is, the
target retains his normal attitude, but will talk, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while
intimidated. The target cooperates, but won't necessarily obey your every whim or do anything that would directly
endanger him.</p>
<p>If you perform some action that makes you more imposing, you gain a circumstance bonus on your Persuasion check. If
your target clearly has a superior position, you suffer a circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>With more than one degree of failure on your check, the target temporarily becomes unfavorable and may do the opposite
of what you want! Succeed
or fail, a target's true attitude towards you generally becomes unfavorable after you attempt an coercion, even if
they go along with you for the moment. You can't retry in the same scene.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The Rock is facing down Packrat in one of his
many rat's nests around Capital City when the big rat commands a pack of his street thieves to keep The Rock from following
him. Packrat doesn't need to roll Persuasion because the kids have a helpful attitude toward him
so the gang of kids step forward to get in The Rock's way. The Rock has no interest in hurting a bunch of kids, so he
bellows, "Get outta the way or I'll knock your blocks off!" and his player decides to use a routine Persuasion
check of 8 to attempt to coerce the entire group of minions into moving out of his way. The street kids are all <a href="gamemastering.html#TOC-THUG">Thugs</a>,
so they have a resistance rank of 0 (their <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> and Will ranks are tied). Since The Rock is
attempting the same effect on every member of the group, he makes a single opposed check. Unfortunately, the GM can't
roll high enough to beat The Rock's result of 8. The street kids know The Rock won't actually hurt them, but they dive out
of the way anyway as The Rock bulls past.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEMORALIZING">DEMORALIZING</h3>
<p>You can use Persuasion as a standard action to undermine an opponent's confidence. Make a Persuasion check
opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> or Will defense (whichever has the highest bonus).
If you succeed with 1 or 2 degrees of success, your target is impaired (a -1 circumstance penalty on checks)
for 1 round. With 3 or more degrees of success, the target is disabled (a -2 penalty) instead.</p>
<p>If you perform some action that makes you more imposing, you gain a circumstance bonus on your Persuasion check. If
your target clearly has a superior position, you suffer a circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>You may attempt to demoralize each round. The victim makes a check to recover each round as though it was an
<a href="powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> with a DC equal to the Persuasion result.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">RANGED COMBAT (Subtype is required)</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Dexterity &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No (for most weapons)</span>
<p>You're trained with a particular type of ranged attack, giving you a bonus to your <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-ATTACKS">attack checks</a>
with it equal to your skill rank. Each ranged attack is a separate Ranged Combat skill with its own rank, and
encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array of <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT">Alternate effects</a>
may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster's discretion.
The bonus from a Ranged Combat skill applies only to attack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses,
countering, power checks, or other uses.</p>
<p>A hero might have Ranged Combat: Pistols or Ranged Combat: Fire Control (a ranged damage power),
but Ranged Combat: Powers is too broad. Ranged Combat: Throwing is an option and includes both thrown weapons and objects a
character simply picks up and throws.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common types of Ranged Combat: Bows, Crossbows, Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, Slings, Small Arms,
Sniper Rifles, Throwing, and Wands. Ranged Combat can be acquired for any ranged attack check and can't be used to
make a close range attack. Likewise ranged attacks exclusively use Ranged Combat to make attack checks.</p>
<p>Most weapons can be used untrained but some weapons such as Wands require skill ranks in order to use.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">SLEIGHT OF HAND</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Dexterity &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You can perform dexterous feats of legerdemain such as palming small objects, picking pockets,
and so forth. Stage magicians use Sleight of Hand legitimately as a performance skill, but it is most
commonly known for its criminal applications.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CONCEALING">CONCEALING</h3>
<p>You can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item on your person, making your check result the DC of an <a
href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a> (to search someone) or <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check to find it.</p>
<p>In order to conceal a small item it must be possible to hide it somewhere. For example if you are stripped naked and
have no hidden compartments then hiding a baseball sized item would be rather impossible. Or if you are trying to hide
an orb of fire and your clothes are not fireproof enough, even if you are, then hiding the object won't be so
simple.</p>
<p>You can also make a Sleight of Hand check to plant a small object on someone, slip something into their pocket, drop
something into their drink, place a tiny radio tracer on them, and so forth. Planting an object is a DC 10 done at the same time.
Perform the check as normal but if your result is less than 10 then you fail to plant the object whether you are noticed or
not.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ENTERTAIN">ENTERTAIN</h3>
<p>Slight of Hand has several entertaining applications mainly stage magic but also juggling, trick shuffling, and cup stacking.
Any action that requires a large amount of hand-eye coordination might be appropriate.</p>
<p>The action is slow and the DC is 10. Although not normally opposed an observer can use <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
to notice any trick employed.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STEALING">STEALING</h3>
<p>To covertly take a small item from another person make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 10). Your target makes a
<a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check and notices the attempt if his check result beats yours, whether you succeed in taking the object or
not. If you fail by one degree you aren't able to take the item but if you fail by two degrees or more then you are
noticed (DC -10) by the character you are trying to steal from.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The Elastibandit is robbing a museum of some
of its valuables when a security guard passes by while making his rounds. The bouncing Bandit has no fear of the rent-a-cop,
so he decides to have some fun. He has <a href="advantages.html#TOC-SKILL-MASTERY">Skill Mastery</a>
for his <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> and, unsurprisingly, the
guard doesn't notice him <a href="powers/effects/movement-movement.html#TOC-SLITHERING">slither</a>
closer, but then Elastibandit decides to try and steal the guard's gun without being
noticed. Bandit has Sleight of Hand +12 and adds that to the roll of the dice getting a total of 14.
The guard, with a <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> skill of only +5, can't possibly notice his gun
being eased out of its holster, so the GM doesn't bother to roll.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STEALTH">STEALTH</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Agility &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Move &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You're skilled at being unnoticed. Generally this requires some kind of partial cover or partial concealment.
If you have total concealment or total cover then using <b>Stealth</b> is generally redundant. Movement is hindered while
using <b>Stealth</b>, see following sections for details.</p>
<p><b>Stealth</b> is a secret check with secret success so that if the observer fails he won't know that someone might be
nearby and if he succeeds you won't know that you have been noticed (although you're likely to quickly find out).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-HIDING">HIDING</h3>
<p>You can roll a <b>Stealth</b> check to hide using cover or blend in using concealment. While this generally applies to
sight and sound it can also be used for other senses if you are capable of hiding from them.</p>
<p>To hide make a <b>Stealth</b> check, opposed by an observer's <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check.
This check is done once per scene or when the circumstances change. A group of observers should make a single
<a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check although separate observers each get a <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
check using the same <b>Stealth</b> result. A patrolling guard should make a single <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
check per area (generally making a routine check).</p>
<p>It is possible to use <b>Stealth</b> while being observed although less useful. The observer doesn't forget about you
and will act accordingly such as sounding an alarm, shining a light into the darkness, or following you behind the object.
Causing a momentary distraction (such as using <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>, a smoke pellet, or flash bang)
will improve you chances of escape. Just like for Dodging area effects you must be close enough to cover or concealment that
you can move there within 1 second (speed - 2). This causes a -2 penalty to the <b>Stealth</b> check because you have to move
quickly.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SNEAKING">SNEAKING</h3>
<p>You can use <b>Stealth</b> to move quietly without being seen but receive penalties based on your speed.</p>
<p>You can move at your speed rank minus 1 or slower with no penalty. You can move at your full speed with a -1 penalty
and faster than that with a -2 circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>If you are sneaking up on someone from behind then then you are considered to have total visual concealment relative
to that person (assuming he can only see what's in front of him). If the subject is worried about being followed, he can make a <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check (opposed by your Stealth check) every time he changes course (goes around a
street corner, exits a building, and so on). If he is unsuspecting, he only gets one <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check for the scene. If the subject notices you, you may make a <a
href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception: Avoid Attention or Bluff</a> check (opposed by <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>)
if the circumstances allow it. However being noticed again makes the <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> much harder
to believe if possible at all.</p>
<p>Note that security cameras and other automatic sensors have a fixed DC rather than rolling <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>.
Someone who is actively controlling the security cameras in order to search for you, on the other hand, rolls <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
with applicable circumstance modifiers (positive or negative, if any).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SURVIVAL">SURVIVAL</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Intellect &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard or Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b>
Tracking is trained only</span>
<p><b>Survival</b> is the ability to survive in an environment. While mainly intended for rural areas such as a forest or tundra
it can also be used in urban and inhabited areas.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-AVOID-HAZARDS">AVOID HAZARDS</h3>
<p>As a free action you can make a <b>Survival</b> check to recall or identify hazards such as recognizing poisonous berries.
As with all <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a> checks it must be possible for you to know this information.</p>
<p>Additionally as a standard action you can make a <b>Survival</b> check to escape from a hazard such as quicksand. This
will likely use Strength or Stamina depending on the hazard.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-GATHERING">GATHERING</h3>
<p>As a slow action you can use <b>Survival</b> to obtain resources such as fruit, water, or firewood. This can be used in
an urban environment such as to pick up trash or search an abandoned warehouse but can't be used to "acquire" anything that
is owned such as attempting to "gather" from someone's pocket. For such activities instead use <a href="#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of hand</a>
and <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-HUNTING">HUNTING</h3>
<p>You may use <b>Survival</b> as a <a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a> roll to recall where to look for your prey,
where to lay traps, and other relevant information. For Tracking see that <b>Survival</b> section and for killing see
<a href="#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> or more likely <a href="#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged Combat</a>. Note that
some prey may hide using <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> (which will require you to use <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MAKE-SHELTER">MAKE SHELTER</h3>
<p>As a slow action that generally uses Strength you can use <b>Survival</b> to make a shelter. This check includes gathering
the material such as leaves and wood. No check is required in areas that have already existing shelters such as caves or buildings.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NAVIGATION">NAVIGATION</h3>
<p>As a standard action you can make a <b>Survival</b> check to avoid getting lost, determine which way is north, determine
your location, determine the current time, or measure passage of time. This check may involve using the sun, the stars, landmarks
or a map.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TRACKING">TRACKING</h3>
<p>This can't be done untrained. As a slow action you can follow a trail by looking for clues such as an overturned
trash can, dropped cigarette, and broken twigs. Use <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> to follow obvious trails
such as foot prints, blood trail, or scent trail, rather than clues. Also see <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> to secretly
follow someone.</p>
