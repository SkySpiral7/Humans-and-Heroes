<h1 class="page-header-red">SKILLS</h1>
<p>Heroes sneak into the closely guarded lairs of criminal masterminds, infiltrate alien computer systems, and build
devices beyond the understanding of modern science. They can piece together obscure clues to a villain's latest plot,
run along tightropes, and pilot vehicles through obstacle courses, all in a day's work. In this game they do so through
the use of various <b>skills</b>.</p>
<h1>SKILL BASICS</h1>
<div class="right-panel red-panel">
<div>Under the Hood: Choosing Skills</div>
<div>
<p>There are a number of factors to consider when choosing skills for your character.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TRAINING-VS.-TALENT">TRAINING VS. TALENT</h3>
<p>In game terms there's no difference between a character who has ranks in a skill because of extensive training and
another whose skill ranks represent a natural talent or aptitude for the skill. Both are considered "trained" in the
skill in game terms. For example, one character might have a high <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill based
on the character's extensive training in negotiation, debate, and management. Another character's <a
href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill may stem more from personal attractiveness or a knack for getting others to
cooperate, while a third character may have a combination of the two. Feel free to decide for yourself what mix of
training and talent your character's skill ranks represent.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-LIFE-SKILLS">LIFE SKILLS</h3>
<p>When allocating skill ranks for your character consider not just the character's role as a hero but also the various
other skills the character may have picked up in day-to-day life.
Some people pick up ranks in <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, although most get by using
the skill untrained. Characters working with technology may have the <a href="#TOC-TECHNOLOGY">Technology</a> skill even
if it doesn't apply to their powers. A particularly well educated person may have various
<a href="#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a> skills. These additional skills help round out a
character and provide some background color and--who knows?--they may turn out to be useful in an adventure at some
point!</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ADVENTURING-SKILLS">ADVENTURING SKILLS</h3>
<p>Also give some thought to the skills your character needs to be effective in game play. Some are obvious, especially
if they're part of your character concept. A mechanic is likely to have ranks in <a
href="#TOC-TECHNOLOGY">Technology</a>, while a doctor should have <a href="#TOC-MEDICAL">Medical</a>. Beyond the
obvious and life skills of your character consider "utility skills" like <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>,
<a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, and <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>, which many characters find useful. A few
ranks in such skills may be a smart investment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Skills are learned abilities, a combination of training (the skill) and natural talent (an ability rank). Each skill
has a rank, used as a bonus to the dice roll when using the skill. To make a skill check, roll:</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">3dF + skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers</span>
<p>The total value is limited by <a href="secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>
(power level +10). For details on each part see the sections below.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SKILL-RANK">SKILL RANK</h2>
<p>Your rank in a skill, based on the points you have invested in that skill. If you have ranks in a skill you're
considered <b>trained</b> in that skill. You can use some skills even if you don't have any ranks in them, known as
using a skill <b>untrained</b>. Some skills may not be used untrained.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ABILITY-MODIFIER">ABILITY MODIFIER</h2>
<p>Each skill has an <b>ability modifier</b> applied to the skill's checks. Each skill's ability modifier is noted in
its description and on <b>Table: Skills</b>. If you use a skill untrained, the ability modifier still applies to
the skill check.</p>
<p>The ability listed in the skill description is only for generalized use and may change based on the situation. For
example Athletics (Str) can be used for climbing (Str), knowing what a butterfly stroke is (Int), or running a marathon (Sta).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-MISCELLANEOUS-MODIFIERS">MISCELLANEOUS MODIFIERS</h2>
<p>Miscellaneous modifiers to skill checks include modifiers for circumstances, and bonuses from advantages or powers,
among others.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ACQUIRING-SKILLS">ACQUIRING SKILLS</h2>
<p>Give your hero skill ranks by spending character points: 2 skill ranks per character point. Skill ranks do not all
need to be assigned to the same skill. You can split them between different skills, thus allowing you to have two skills
with an odd number of ranks as long as the total of all skills is even. Characters can perform some tasks without any
training, using only raw talent (as defined by their ability ranks), but skilled characters are better at such things.
Having a variety of skills will allow your character to be effective at a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>You may use <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait</a> to raise a skill which would
have the same effect except that it is considered the
result of powers and not experience and thus can have modifiers and be lost during a power loss complication etc.
Another difference is that powers handle fractions differently than skills so an <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait: Skill</a>
can't split points between another and thus should always be an even number of ranks (limited by <a href="secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>).</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Skill Cost = 1 character point per 2 skill ranks.</span>
<h2 id="TOC-FINDING-THE-SKILL-YOU-WANT">FINDING THE SKILL YOU WANT</h2>
<p>If you don't find a particular skill on the list, like climbing, bluffing, or search, remember that each skill covers
a lot of ground. So, you'll find climbing isn't its own skill, but is listed as part of <a
href="#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a>, while bluffing and search are under <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> and <a
href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a>, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill you think is most
similar to what you're looking for.</p>
<h1>HOW SKILLS WORK</h1>
<p>When you use a skill, make a skill check to see how you do. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or
beat a particular number to use the skill successfully. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.
(See <b>Checks</b>, for more information.)</p>
<h2 id="TOC-UNTRAINED-SKILL-CHECKS">UNTRAINED SKILL CHECKS</h2>
<p>Generally, if you attempt a task requiring a skill you don't have, you make a skill
check as normal. Skill rank doesn't apply because you don't have any ranks in the skill. You do get other modifiers,
however, such as the skill's ability modifier.</p>
<p>Many skills can only be used if you are trained in them. Skills that cannot be used untrained are marked with a "No"
in the "Untrained" column on <b>Table: Skills</b> and listed as "Trained Only" in their descriptions. Attempts to
use these skills untrained automatically fail. In some cases, a skill may have both trained and untrained aspects; if
you do not have any ranks in that skill, you can only use the untrained parts.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-INTERACTION-SKILLS">INTERACTION SKILLS</h2>
<p>Certain skills, called <b>interaction skills</b>, are aimed at dealing with others through social interaction.
Interaction skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get them to cooperate with you in one way or
another. Since interaction skills are intended for dealing with others socially, they have certain requirements.</p>
<p>First, you must be able to interact with the subject(s) of the skill. They must be aware of you and able to understand
you. If they can't hear or understand you for some reason, you have a -2 circumstance penalty to your skill check (see
<b>Circumstance Modifiers</b> in <a href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a>).</p>
<p>Interaction skills work best on intelligent subjects, ones with an Intellect rank of -3 or better. You can use them
on creatures with less Int, but again with a -2 circumstance penalty: they're just too dumb to get the subtleties of your
point. You can't use interaction skills at all on subjects lacking one or more mental abilities such as trying to
convince a rock to be your friend or to be afraid of you.</p>
<p>You can use interaction skills on groups of subjects at once, but only to achieve the same result for everyone. So
you can attempt to use <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> or <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> to convince a
group of something, or <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> to cow a crowd, for example, but you can't convince
some individuals of one thing and the rest of another, or demoralize some and not others. The GM decides if a particular
use of an interaction skill is effective against a group, and may apply modifiers depending on the situation. The
general rules for interaction still apply: everyone in the group must be able to hear and understand you, for example,
or you suffer a -2 on your skill check against them. Mindless subjects are unaffected, as usual.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-MANIPULATION-SKILLS">MANIPULATION SKILLS</h2>
<p>Some skills, called <b>manipulation skills</b>, require a degree of fine physical manipulation. You need prehensile
limbs and a Dexterity rank or some suitable Precise power effect to use manipulation skills effectively. If your physical
manipulation capabilities are impaired in some fashion (such as having your hands tied or full use of only one hand),
the GM may impose a circumstance modifier based on the severity of the impairment. Characters lacking the ability to use
manipulation skills can still have ranks in them and use them to oversee or assist the work of others (see <b>Team
Checks</b>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TOOLS">TOOLS</h3>
<p>Some manipulation skills require tools. If tools are needed, the specific items are mentioned in the description of the
skill. If you don't have the appropriate tools, you may still be able to attempt the task, but at a major disadvantage,
for a -2 circumstance penalty on your check, if the GM decides you can attempt the task at all.</p>
<p>A character may be able to put together makeshift tools in order to make the check. If the GM allows this, reduce the
circumstance penalty to -1.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SKILL-BENCHMARKS">SKILL BENCHMARKS</h2>
<p>You can get a general idea of just how good a particular character's skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class guidelines given in <a href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a> along with the rules for routine checks (see <b>Routine
Checks</b>).</p>
<p>For example, a +5 total skill modifier means the character can routinely achieve a result of 5 (a tough task). Safe
to say the character is a pro, able to routinely handle tasks that would prove too much for someone less skilled. A
character with a +10 skill modifier achieve a DC 10 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of expertise,
while a +15 modifier can routinely complete DC 15 (formidable) tasks. At the high end, a +30 skill modifier can
routinely accomplishing the nigh impossible (DC 30 tasks)!</p>
<h1>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
<p>This section describes the skills available to characters, including their common uses and modifiers. Characters may
be able to use skills for tasks other than those given here. The GM sets the DC and decides the results in those cases.
The format for skill descriptions is given here. Items that do not apply are omitted from the skill's description.</p>

<p>Use Acrobatics to flip, dive, roll, tumble, and perform other acrobatic maneuvers, as well as keeping your balance
under difficult circumstances. Some things can be done untrained, see descriptions below, for all other cases it
generally can't be done untrained at the GM's discretion.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BALANCING">BALANCING</h3>
<p>This is a move action and can be done untrained. You can keep your balance and move along a precarious surface at your ground speed minus
1 rank with a successful Acrobatics check against the surface's DC. A degree of failure indicates you spend your move
action just maintaining your balance and do not actually move, while two or more degrees of failure means you lose your
balance and fall.</p>
<p>You are vulnerable while balancing. If you accept a +2 increase to the Acrobatics DC, you are not vulnerable.</p>
<p>Each movement while balancing requires an Acrobatics check.
Some circumstances (such as being attacked) may also require an immediate Acrobatics check to stay balanced.
If you fail a resistance check while balancing, make an immediate Acrobatics check with a penalty equal to the
DC to of the resistance check that was failed to avoid falling. For example being affected by an <a href="powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>
5 would require an Acrobatics check with a penalty of 5 (on top of the normal Acrobatics DC).
At the end of your turn if you are still balancing
but have not yet made an Acrobatics check this turn then you must do so now with a +1 bonus.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-MANEUVERING">MANEUVERING</h3>
<p>This is a move action and some maneuvers can be done untrained at the GM's discretion. You can make Acrobatics checks for various acrobatic
stunts or maneuvers, from back flips to jumping over an opponent (to get behind them), flipping up onto a ledge,
tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneuver, while failure
means you do not, and two or more degrees of failure usually means you slip and end up prone (and may suffer additional
effects, depending on the stunt). A successful acrobatic maneuver may provide you a circumstance bonus on certain
follow-up actions, if the GM sees fit.</p>
<p>Feats of flexibility fall under this category (such as doing the splits or touching your toes) and generally have very low DC.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STANDING">STANDING</h3>
<p>This is a free action and can't be done untrained. You can make a DC 10 Acrobatics check to go from prone to standing as a free action
rather than a move action. A failed check means you remain prone and can't be attempted again this turn.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TUMBLING">TUMBLING</h3>
<p>This is a free action and can't be done untrained. You can make an Acrobatics check (DC -5) as a free action to lessen damage from a fall,
reducing the damage by 1 per degree of success. A fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you quickly roll to your feet.
Otherwise, you are prone at the end of a fall.</p>

</div>
<p>With a successful Athletics check, you can climb along a slope, wall, or other steep incline at your ground speed
rank minus 2 as a move action. A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface can't be climbed without the <a href="powers/effects/movement-movement.html#TOC-WALL-CRAWLING">Wall-crawling</a>
power.</p>
<p>Make an Athletics check for each movement. A failed Athletics check indicates you make no progress, and two or more degrees of failure means you fall from
whatever height you attained (unless you are secured with a safety harness or other equipment). You can make an Athletics check
to catch yourself with DC equal to the initial check + 3. Someone else within arm's reach can also make an Athletics check
to catch you with the same DC. If your attempt to catch someone else gets more than one degree of failure, you fall as
well.</p>
<p>Since you can't easily move to avoid attacks, you are vulnerable while climbing unless you accept a +2 increase in
the DC. If you fail a resistance check while climbing, make an immediate Athletics check with a penalty equal to the
DC to of the resistance check that was failed to avoid falling. For example being affected by an <a href="powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>
5 would require an Athletics check with a penalty of 5 (on top of the normal Athletics DC).</p>
<p>At the GM's discretion, certain kinds of climbing attempts might require tools like ropes, pitons, harness, and so
forth. Attempting such a climb without tools incurs a -2 circumstance penalty.
You get a bonus or penalty based on your mass rank which is 2 - your mass rank (see
<a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Action &amp; Adventure: Relative Size Rules</a>).</p>
<p>Athletics is also used to hold onto a ledge using the same Climbing rules.</p>

<p>The result of an Athletics check is the distance (in feet) you can clear in a running long-jump. If you make a
standing jump, divide the distance in half. If you make a vertical jump (straight up) divide the distance by 5, and if
you make a standing vertical jump, divide it by 10.</p>
<p>Your Athletics bonus is the base distance you can jump under routine circumstances. So a hero with a +20
Athletics bonus can make a routine long-jump of 20 feet, a standing long-jump of 10 feet, a vertical jump of 4 feet, and
a standing vertical jump of 2 feet on a routine basis.</p>
<p>You get a bonus or penalty based on your mass rank which is 2 - your mass rank (see
<a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Action &amp; Adventure: Relative Size Rules</a>)</p>
<p>If you want your hero to jump tens, hundreds, thousands of feet, or even miles, see <a

<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-SPRINTING">SPRINTING</h3>
<p>You can make a DC 5 Athletics (Str) check as a free action to run faster: one or more degree of success increases
your ground speed rank by +1 for one round. However doing this for more than one move action in a row is likely to
require some kind of Stamina check.</p>

<p>Each move action used to swim requires an Athletics check. A successful DC 0 Athletics
check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the check
fails, you make no progress through the water during the action. With more than one degree of failure, you go under. If
underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning (see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">Suffocation</a>).
At the end of your turn if you are still swimming but have not yet made an Athletics check this turn then you must do so now.</p>
<p>Swimming can't be performed untrained, however it can be performed to a lesser degree with Extra Effort (for a
Victory Point you can gain the full benefits see <b>Heroic Feat</b>). If you use Extra Effort then a DC 5 Athletics
(Sta) check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 3 as a standard action in order to dog paddle or tred
water.</p>

<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Fighting &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No (for most weapons)</span>
<p>You're trained with a particular type of close attack, giving you a bonus to your <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-ATTACKS">attack checks</a> with it equal to your
skill rank. Each close attack is a separate Close Combat skill with its own rank, and
encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array of <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT">Alternate effects</a>
may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster's discretion.
The bonus from a Close Combat skill applies only to attack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses,
countering, power checks, or other uses.</p>
<p>A hero might have Close Combat: Swords, but Close Combat: Melee Weapons is too broad. Close Combat: Unarmed is an
option, meaning skill with unarmed strikes like punches and kicks. This bonus also applies to other forms of
unarmed combat maneuvers such as grabbing and tripping.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common types of Close Combat: Unarmed, Improvised Weapons, Swords, Spears, Clubs, Daggers, Tonfa,
Nunchaku, Sythe, Chainsaw, and Halberd. Close Combat can be acquired for any close range attack and can't be used to

<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Various &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> Yes &#8226; <b>Type</b>: Various</span>
<p>This is a catch-all skill used for all types of competition that have an objective winner such as board games, war games,
actual war (eg being a military general), baseball, and archery. This skill is not used for contests with subjective winners
(anything that requires judges to vote) such as
a beauty contest, singing contest, or gymnastics for such things see <a href="#TOC-PERFORMANCE">Performance</a> instead.
This skill can be used for single player games such as solitaire.</p>
<p>Competition is trained only because a character needs to at least know the win condition and rules to be able to play.
In the case of war a military leader needs to know how surrender and peace agreements work and what he is not allowed to
do (as imposed by his home country or international agreement).
The ability used and skill type depend on the competition chosen.
Competition has little value to H&amp;H and is included for the sake of completeness and for character background.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CONTORTION">CONTORTION</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Agility &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Full or Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You can fix your body in and out of tight places such as escaping handcuffs or squeezing between 2 objects.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SQUEEZING">SQUEEZING</h3>
<p>As a full turn action you can use Contortion to fit through a tight space
wide enough for your head but too narrow for the width of your shoulders, or to reach through an opening wide enough for
your hand, but too narrow for your arm. The base DC is 10 but may be higher depending on how tight it is. Success means you can move at your base speed -4.
Failure means you are stuck where you are (either stuck inside or can't fit in). Moving is part of this full turn action
therefore each movement requires a Contortion check.</p>
<p>You can also contort your body without objects present if you'd like to fold yourself into a smaller shape for example.</p>

<p>Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you want them to believe. It covers things like acting,
bluffing, fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.</p>
<p>Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story. Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move action by taking a -2 penalty to your check.</p>
<p>Deception is usually opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check but may also be opposed by
Deception (Int) to recognize deceptive techniques being used.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-AVOIDING-ATTENTION">AVOIDING ATTENTION</h3>
<p>You can make a Deception check to blend into a crowd, hide guilt, or avoid suspicion. While disguise is used to prevent people
from recognizing you this use of deception is used to prevent people from noticing you. For example while playing poker
you can roll Deception to prevent others form reading your expression as easily (an opposed check against <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BLUFFING">BLUFFING</h3>
<p>Make a Deception check to tell a believable lie or get someone to go along with you. Note that believability and risk
are according to the character you are trying to deceive.</p>
<p>A bluff is opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances
weigh heavily on the outcome. Two circumstances can work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what you ask
goes against the target's self-interest, nature, or personality. Ordinary deception can only do so much, for anything
beyond this you will need the powers of either <a href="powers/effects/sample-powers/mind-control.html">Mind Control</a> or
<a href="powers/effects/mental-transform-attack.html">Mental Transform</a>. In the case of something unbelievable,
even if telling the truth people might not believe you. However if the existence of super powers
is well known then there are many circumstances that might not seem so unbelievable.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The sorcerer Tim leads a group of knights to
a cave guarded by a terrible monster who has slain dozens of knights. Upon arrival Tim points to an ordinary looking bunny
and tells them that it is the monster. Despite being the truth the knights refuse to believe it, charge in, fight a hopeless
battle losing several men, and retreat. Maybe if Tim explained that the bunny was not ordinary the knights would have considered it.</p>
<p>If it's important, you can distinguish between a deception that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the target gets a +4 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands some kind of risk, and the resistance check succeeds by 4 or less, then the target doesn't so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check succeeds
by 5 or more, he has seen through the deception, and would have refused even if it had not placed unusual demands on
him (that is, even without the +4 modifier).</p>

<p>You can use Deception to send covert messages using word-play and double-meanings while apparently talking about
other things. The DC for a basic message is 0. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new information have
DCs of 5 or 10, respectively. The recipient of the message must make a <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check against
the same DC to understand it.</p>
<p>Anyone listening in on your innuendo can attempt an <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check against the message DC. If successful, the
eavesdropper notices that there is a message hidden in your conversation. If the eavesdropper gets at least two degrees of success, he
also understands the message. Whether trying to send or pick up on a message, more than one degree of failure on the
check means the receiver misinterprets the message in some fashion.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-DISGUISE">DISGUISE</h3>
<p>You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance. Your Deception check result determines the
effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others' <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly so
you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Disguise is heavily dependent on circumstances: favorable ones include appropriate costuming and a subject resembling
your normal appearance, while unfavorable circumstances include disguising yourself as a member of a different race or
sex, or not having sufficient props (which can be up to a -2 modifier). If you are impersonating a particular
individual, anyone who knows that individual gets a circumstance bonus to the <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
check: regular associates get a +1, while friends get a +2 and intimate loved ones a +4.</p>
<p>Successfully acting like who you appear to be may also require a Deception check with a DC equal to the observer's <a
href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check, modified by familiarity if the observer knows the subject well, as mentioned
previously.</p>
<p>A disguise normally requires at least 10 minutes of preparation. The GM makes <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> checks for those who
encounter you immediately upon meeting you and each hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DISTRACTION">DISTRACTION</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to cause a distraction, hold someone's attention, or drown out a sound. You can distract either a
group or an individual opposed by either <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> to realize that this is a distraction or
<a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> to notice what is being hidden.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FEINTING">FEINTING</h3>
<p>You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a standard
action opposed by your target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>. If your Deception check succeeds, the target is
vulnerable against your next attack until the end of your next turn (see <b>Vulnerable</b> <a href="the-basics/conditions.html">condition</a>).</p>
<p>Not to be confused with fainting, although playing dead is a possible deception for which you'll need to fall prone regardless
of your check and need to stay that way for a round.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-TRICKING">TRICKING</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action, such as trying to hit you while
standing in front of an electrical junction box or at the edge of a precipice. If your Deception check opposed by
<a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> succeeds, your opponent is heedless of the potential danger and may hit the junction box
or lose his balance and fall, if his attack against you fails. (On the other hand, if the attack succeeds, it might slam
you into the junction box or send you flying off the edge. You're taking a risk.)</p>
<p>More than one degree of failure on the Deception check means you put yourself in a bad position; you are vulnerable
against the target's attacks for 1 round!</p>

<p>You can use Insight to pick up on hidden messages sent via the <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> skill.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETECT-ILLUSION">DETECT ILLUSION</h3>
<p>The GM makes a secret Insight check to determine if your hero senses the true nature of an illusion (DC = Illusion
rank). Success means you pick up on a flaw in the illusion, sensing it is not real which allows a Will defense check to overcome it.
Insight itself can't be used to overcome an illusion. See <a href="powers/effects/illusion-control.html">Illusion</a> effect for details.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETECT-INFLUENCE">DETECT INFLUENCE</h3>
<p>You can make a Insight check to notice someone acting under outside influence. The DC is equal to the rank of the effect
or skill affecting the subject. If you succeed, you notice the subject is not acting entirely of his or her own will.
Three or more degrees give you a general idea of what is influencing them (and perhaps even whom, depending on the
situation and the Gamemaster's judgment).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETECT-PERSUASION">DETECT PERSUASION</h3>
<p>You can make a Insight check to notice that someone is trying to <a href="TOC-PERSUASION">Persuade</a> you using common techniques

check will allow you to make decisions with a clear mind, resisting the influence of <a href="TOC-PERSUASION">Persuade</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DETERMINE-ATTITUDE">DETERMINE ATTITUDE</h3>
<p>With an Insight check, opposed by <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>, you can tell if someone is trustworthy and
honorable (or not) upon meeting them. You can also make an Insight check (DC 10) to evaluate a social situation, getting
a feel for the overall mood and prevailing attitudes. Two or more degrees of failure on either check mean you
misinterpret the signs, so the GM may make these checks for you in secret.</p>

<p>By succeeding at a DC 0 Investigation check taking at least an hour, you get a feel for the major news and rumors in
an area. This assumes no obvious reasons exist why information would be withheld. The degree of the check result
determines the completeness and detail of the information. Information ranges from general to protected, and the DC
increases accordingly for the type of information, as given on the table.</p>
<p>General information concerns local happenings, rumors, gossip, and the like.</p>
<p>Specific information usually relates to a particular question.</p>
<p>Restricted information isn't generally known and requires you to locate someone with access to the information.</p>
<p>Protected information is even harder to come by and might involve some danger, either for the one asking the

<p>You can search an area for clues, hidden items, traps, and other details. <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
allows you to immediately notice things, while an Investigation check allows you to pick up on details with some
effort.</p>
<p>To determine how long it takes to search a given area, take the total area measurement (in square feet, yards, or
miles), find the time measurement for that distance, and add 2. So searching 60 square feet (roughly an 8 ft. by 8 ft.
room) takes the time rank of 60 feet (rank 1), plus 2, or 1 minute (time rank 3). Searching a square mile takes the time
rank of 1 mile (rank 8), plus 2, or two hours (time rank 10).</p>
<p>The DC for an Investigation check to find a concealed object is usually opposed by the <a
href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> or <a href="#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a> check of the character who hid
it.</p>
<p>Searching an area will have a DC that depends on your size see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Action &amp; Adventure: Relative Size Rules</a>
for more details.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-17" id="TOC-URBAN-TRACKING">URBAN TRACKING</h3>
<p>This can't be done untrained. You can follow a trail through an urban area by looking for clues such as an overturned

<div>Under the Hood: Character Knowledge vs. Player Expertise</div>
<div>
<p>Knowledge skills measure what your character knows about various things, whether you know anything about them or not.
It's fairly easy to measure what a hero knows by making the appropriate skill check or looking at the routine check
value (which is equal to the total bonus).</p>
<p>However, players may know things their characters do not, either because of the player's life experience or knowledge
of the game and its rules (and source material). In this case the Gamemaster may prefer players limit themselves to only
what Knowledge skills their heroes have rather than what they may or may not know about a given situation. The GM may
bend this rule by allowing a player to spend a victory point to have a character act upon something he or she would have
no way of knowing, calling it a "hunch" or a "lucky guess" (a version of the inspiration rule). See <b>victory
points</b>.</p>
<p>If there's a question as to how to handle an issue of player versus character expertise in the game, consult your
Gamemaster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Knowledge is a broad skill encompassing a variety of specialized fields. Each is considered a separate skill and
knowledge in each is acquired separately, so a person might have Knowledge: Nature and Knowledge: Technology, each with
their own ranks, for example.</p>
<p>If the DC is 0 or less then it can be done untrained (DC 1 or more requires skill ranks). This represents common knowledge
or common sense, things that can easily be picked up without training.</p>
<p>Not all knowledge can be obtained from knowledge rolls. Any knowledge that isn't spread or that your character couldn't
have heard can't be obtained by a knowledge check. For example you can't roll Knowledge: Criminal to learn
the combination to a personal safe if there was no way for that combination to have been spread. You also can't roll
Knowledge: History to learn about past events of a planet you've never heard of. Also see the <a href="powers/effects/attain-knowledge-general.html">Attain Knowledge</a> power.</p>
<p>Knowledge checks can't use any other ability and therefore Knowledge ranks can at best provide a circumstance bonus when
attempting the application of the Knowledge. However every other skill can be used as an appropriate Knowledge check by using Intelligence as
the ability. For example Athletics (Str) can be used as Knowledge: Swimming (Int) to answer
the question "what is a butterfly stroke?" but on the other hand Knowledge: Swimming (Int) can't be used as Athletics
(Str). For another example Knowledge: Investigation can represent experience in the field and thus a successful roll can name
the best places to start looking for evidence providing a +1 bonus to the following
<a href="#TOC-ANALYZE-EVIDENCE">Investigation: Analyze Evidence</a> check.</p>
<p>The reason why a character would put ranks in Knowledge instead of (or in addition to) another skill is for role
playing reasons (such as a student who knows more than he can apply) and because some knowledge doesn't have an application
skill.</p>
<p>All other skills can have a Knowledge equivalent. The following are other examples of suitable
areas of Knowledge. This list is by no means exhaustive, the GM should feel free to add to or modify this list as needed
to suit the game and the characters in it.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Appraise</b>: You can determine the value of goods and services. A failed skill check means you don't
know the value, the Gamemaster may (or may not) provide a false value depending on the situation. This skill can be used
to determine the value both locally and elsewhere such as a caravan knowing the value of silk in both China and Egypt.
This skill can be used to appraise illegal goods and services and for knowing currency exchange rates.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Criminal</b>: In addition to knowing some common techniques of committing crimes you may also know where
to find criminals and how to locate a black market.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Dimensions</b>: You know what other dimensions exist and what they contain (creatures, landscapes etc).
If the physics is different or time travels differently you can roll this knowledge to see if you know about it.
Knowledge: Dimensions should only be used for common knowledge about and within dimensions and should not be used to determine
specifics. For example you can use Knowledge: Dimensions to know that there's another dimension filled with water that contains
mermaids and other aquatic life but if you'd like to know if a specific fish in said dimension is poisonous then you'll need to
roll a <a href="#TOC-SURVIVAL">Survival</a> skill check. This skill is especially useful if you can travel between dimensions
(see <a href="powers/effects/movement-movement.html#TOC-DIMENSION-TRAVEL">movement power</a>).
This knowledge is highly dependent on the setting of the game so ask your Gamemaster before taking this skill if other dimensions
exist or if they matter.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: History</b>: While history is generally just academic it may prove useful to know about past events such as
when <a href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigating</a>. This skill is especially useful to time travelers assuming history hasn't
changed.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Law</b>: knowing the law well is useful to those who are trying to evade and those trying to convict.
This can be used for laws of all sizes: local, national, global, or larger.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Linguistics</b>: The study of language. This can be used to identify hand writing although this can also be done
by <a href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation (Analyze Evidence)</a>. This skill can be used to translate a language you
don't know (although this is very difficult and requires a lot of time and resources). Also see the <a href="advantages.html#TOC-LANGUAGES">Languages advantage</a>.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Religion</b>: You know the lore of various religions such as the names of gods and goddesses and the stories
involved. You also know the religious laws, traditions, holy symbols, and practical applications. This knowledge is especially
useful to those who directly interact with spiritual forces such as a demon hunter.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Trivia</b>: A collection of random facts that are commonly used in trivia contests. None of them should
be obvious and few of them useful.</p>
<p>Other examples include: Astronomy, Business, Culture, Current Events, Dungeoneering, Geography, Magic, Military, Music,
Nobility, Philosophy, Politics, Science, Sociology, and Streetwise.</p>

<p>Providing care means treating an injured patient for an hour or more at DC 5. If successful, the patient doubles recovery rate
(see <a href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RECOVERY">Recovery</a>). You can
provide care for a number of patients (including yourself) up to your Medical rank at one time. Tools may be required depending
on the ailment such as ice packs or splints, failing to have the required tools incurs a -2 circumstance penalty.
You take a -2 circumstance penalty on the Medical check to treat yourself.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STABILIZE">STABILIZE</h3>
<p>As a standard action, a successful DC 5 Medical check stabilizes a dying character. This may require tools such as bandages,
failing to have the required tools incurs a -2 circumstance penalty.
This can't be done on yourself since you won't be able to take the standard action required.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TREAT-DISEASE-AND-POISON">TREAT DISEASE AND POISON</h3>
<p>As a standard action you can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison. The next time this round that the patient
makes a resistance check against the ailment, you make a Medical check at DC 5. 1 or 2 degrees of success provides the patient with a +1 circumstance
bonus to the resistance check, 3 or more degrees of success provides a +2 circumstance bonus. Only a single Medical check can be done
per affliction resistance check, if multiple exist only the highest rank applies. Unlike normal <a href="the-basics/index.html#TOC-TEAM-CHECKS">team checks</a>
failing will not provide a penalty. This can be done on yourself at no penalty. The tools required are medicine or antivenom etc
and can't be performed without tools.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-PERCEPTION">PERCEPTION</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Awareness &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>Use this skill to notice and pick up on things. Discerning details--such as clearly hearing conversation or reading
fine text--requires at least three degrees of success on the Perception check.</p>
<p>In general, you have a -1 circumstance penalty to Perception checks for every 15 feet between you and what you
are trying to perceive. So hearing a noise from 60 feet away is a -4 modifier to your Perception check, for example.</p>
<p>The GM usually makes Perception checks secretly so you don't know whether there was nothing to notice or you simply
failed to notice it. The common sorts of Perception checks are:</p>
<h3 id="TOC-HEARING">HEARING</h3>
<p>Make a check against a DC based on how loud the noise is or against an opposed <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>
check. Normal conversation or unarmed combat is DC -10, a soft noise DC 0, a loud noise is DC -20 such as metal striking
metal, and a very loud noise such as a gun shot is DC -30. The DC gets a +2 per inch of material that is in the way such
as a door or solid wall in addition to the -1 per 15 ft distance penalty (not to be confused with the skill distance
penalty). While you're asleep, hearing something well enough to wake up is +5 DC (see <b>conditions</b> for more
information on sleep).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SEEING">SEEING</h3>
<p>Make a check against a DC based on how visible the object is or against an opposed <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>
check. Something in plain sight is DC -10, while something subtle or easily over-looked may be DC -5, 0 or more. Visual
perception is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the <b><a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a></b> skill) or
to notice a concealed object (see the <b><a href="#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a></b> skill).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-OTHER-SENSES">OTHER SENSES</h3>
<p>You can make Perception checks involving other sense types as well (see <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a> for more
on sense types). Noticing something obvious to a sense is DC -10. Less obvious things are DC 0 or so, hidden things DC 10
or more, and discerning details requires at least three degrees of success, as usual.</p>
<p>You can make a Perception check every time you have the opportunity to notice something new. As a move action, you
can attempt to notice something you failed (or believe you failed) to notice previously.</p>
<p>Various sensory effects provide modifiers on Perception checks (see <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a>).</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Performance">Performance (Subtype is required)</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Presence &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Slow &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No &#8226; <b>Type</b>: Manipulation with required tools (where applicable)</span>

<h2 id="TOC-INTIMIDATION">INTIMIDATION</h2>
<span class="info-banner">Presence &#8226; Interaction</span>
<p>You know how to use threats (both real and implied) to get others to do what you want.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-COERCING">COERCING</h3>
<p>Make an Intimidation check, opposed by the target's insight or Will defense (whichever has the highest bonus). If
your check succeeds, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for actions taken in your presence. That is, the
target retains his normal attitude, but will talk, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while
intimidated. The target cooperates, but won't necessarily obey your every whim or do anything that would directly
endanger him.</p>
<p>If you perform some action that makes you more imposing, you gain a circumstance bonus on your Intimidation check. If
your target clearly has a superior position, you suffer a circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>With more than one degree of failure on your check, the target may actually do the opposite of what you want! Succeed
or fail, a target's true attitude towards you generally becomes hostile after you attempt an Intimidation check, even if
they go along with you for the moment.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEMORALIZING">DEMORALIZING</h3>
<p>You can use Intimidation in combat as a standard action to undermine an opponent's confidence. Make an Intimidation
check as a standard action. If it succeeds with 1 or 2 degrees of success, your target is impaired (a -1 circumstance penalty on checks)
for 1 round. With 3 or more degrees of success, the target is disabled (a -2 penalty) instead.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-INTIMIDATING-MINIONS">INTIMIDATING MINIONS</h3>
<p>You can intimidate a whole group of minions--who can all see and hear you--with a single check. If the group has you
at a disadvantage, you suffer the usual circumstance penalty on your check. Compare your check result against a single
resistance check made by the GM for the entire group. Your Intimidation check must have the same effect on every member
of the group (that is, you cannot demoralize some and coerce others, for example).</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The Rock is facing down Packrat in one of his
many bolt holes around Capital City when the big rat commands a pack of his street thieves to keep The Rock from following
him. The gang of kids steps forward to get in The Rock's way. The Rock has no interest in hurting a bunch of kids, so he
bellows, "Get outta the way or I'll knock your blocks off!" and his player decides to use The Rock's routine Intimidation
check of 8 to attempt to coerce the entire group of minions into moving out of his way. The street kids are all Thugs, so
they have a resistance rank of 0 (their <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> and Will ranks are tied). Since Rocky is
attempting the same effect on every member of the group, he makes a single opposed check. Unfortunately, the GM can't
roll high enough to beat The Rock's 8. The street kids know The Rock won't actually hurt them, but they dive out
of the way anyway as The Rock bulls past.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PERSUASION">PERSUASION</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Presence &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No &#8226; <b>Type</b>: Interaction</span>
<p>You're skilled in dealing with people, from etiquette and social graces to a way with words and public speaking, all
of which helps to get your point across, make a good impression, negotiate, and generally win people over to your way of
seeing things.</p>
<p>In negotiations, all participants roll Persuasion checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve
cases where two advocates plead opposing cases before a third party.</p>
<p>Non-player characters each have an initial attitude towards you or your cause. The GM chooses the character's initial
attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a specific
circumstance or complication may call for a different attitude. Attitude may also change over time. Additionally the average person
is rarely, if ever, hostile since most people have some kind of moral or social standard.</p>
<p>You can improve others' attitudes with a DC 5 Persuasion check. Success improves the subject's attitude by one step,
while every two additional degrees of success improve it by another step (so two steps at three degrees, three steps at
five degrees, and so forth). Failure means no change, and more than a degree of failure worsens the subject's attitude
by one (and only 1) step!
In the case of a hostile subject, they may outright attack or otherwise interfere with you if their
attitude worsens.</p>
<h3 class="table-name">TABLE: ATTITUDES</h3>

</table>
<p>Persuading someone is at least a standard action, usually quite a bit longer. The GM decides if you can persuade at
all once a conflict has broken out! Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can only be persuaded so
far; you can try again in the same scene, but you check against the subject's initial attitude, and may end up worsening
it rather than improving it!</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The heroes must convince the imperious King
of Atlantis that the surface world is not responsible for recent attacks against his kingdom in order to avert a war. The
king's attitude is unfavorable towards these surface-world interlopers to begin with. The team's spokesperson makes a
Persuasion attempt and gets a check result of 12, a success with two degrees total. That shifts the king's attitude one
step, to indifferent. He's inclined to continue negotiating with the heroes and willing to place the assault on the surface
world on-hold for the time-being. The heroes try to convince the king further, but any additional checks need at least the
same degree of success as the first to get his attitude to favorable, where he is willing to call off the attack, and more
than one degree of failure on any check moves his attitude to hostile, where he orders the intruders arrested and the
attack to begin at once!</p>
<p>If a Persuasion check fails, trying again is futile; the subject is too set against your arguments. At the GM's
discretion, you can try again when the situation changes in some way: you find a new approach to your argument, new
evidence appears, and so forth. The GM may consider you at a disadvantage in further negotiations, imposing a
circumstance penalty as well.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">RANGED COMBAT (Subtype is required)</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Dexterity &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No (for most weapons)</span>
<p>You're trained with a particular type of ranged attack, giving you a bonus to your attack checks with it equal to
your skill rank (see <b>Attack Check</b> in <a href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a> and in <a
href="action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>). Each ranged attack is a separate Ranged Combat skill with
its own rank, and encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array may be considered one power, at the
Gamemaster's discretion (see <b>Alternate Effects</b> in <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a> for more information).</p>
<p>So a hero might have Ranged Combat: Small Arms or Ranged Combat: Fire Control (a ranged damage power), but Ranged
Combat: Powers is too broad. Ranged Combat: Throwing is an option and includes both thrown weapons and objects a
character simply picks up and throws.</p>
<p>The bonus from a Ranged Combat skill applies only to attack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses,
countering, power checks, or other uses. Keep in mind that the skill distance penalty in this case is an attack penalty (not damage). In
this system any weapon can be used untrained as a +0 skill modifier.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common types of Ranged Combat: Small Arms, Throwing, Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles,
Bows, Crossbows, and Slings.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">SLEIGHT OF HAND</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Dexterity &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You can perform dexterous feats of legerdemain such as palming small objects, picking pockets, slipping out of
restraints, and so forth. Stage magicians use Sleight of Hand legitimately as a performance skill, but it is most
commonly known for its criminal applications.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CONCEALING">CONCEALING</h3>
<p>You can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item on your person, making your check result the DC of an <a
href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a> or <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check to find it.</p>
<p>In order to conceal a small item it must be possible to hide it somewhere. For example if you are stripped naked and
have no hidden compartments then hiding a baseball sized item would be rather impossible. Or if you are trying to hide
an orb of fire and your clothes are not fireproof enough, even if you are, then hiding the object won't be so
simple.</p>
<p>You can also make a Sleight of Hand check to plant a small object on someone, slip something into their pocket, drop
something into their drink, place a tiny radio tracer on them, and so forth. To plant the object, you must get a check
result of 10 or higher, regardless of the opponent's check result. The opponent notices the attempt if his check result
beats yours, whether you succeed in planting the item or not.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-LEGERDEMAIN">LEGERDEMAIN</h3>
<p>Minor feats of sleight of hand on a small item, such as making a coin or playing card "vanish," have a DC of 0
unless an observer is focused on noticing what you are doing. When you perform this skill under observation, your check
is opposed by the observer's <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check to see if they notice the trick.</p>
<p>If you pass the DC 0 the difference in success counts towards Concealing the object (see above) however if anyone's
Perception beat your result that person may find the item without needing to roll.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STEALING">STEALING</h3>
<p>To covertly take a small item from another person make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 10). Your target makes a
perception check and notices the attempt if his check result beats yours, whether you succeed in taking the object or
not. If you fail by one degree you aren't able to take the item but if you fail by two degrees or more then you are
noticed (DC -10) by the character you are trying to steal from.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: The Elastibandit is robbing a museum of some
of its valuables when a security guard passes by while making his rounds. The bouncing Bandit has no fear of the rent-a-cop,
so he decides to have some fun. He has Skill Mastery for his <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> and, unsurprisingly, the
guard doesn't notice him slither closer, but then Elastibandit decides to try and steal the guard's gun without being
noticed. Bandit has Sleight of Hand +12 and adds that to the roll of the dice. A whopping 19 plus 12 for a total of 31!
The guard, with a <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> skill of only +5, doesn't have a prayer of noticing his gun
being eased out of its holster, but the GM rolls anyway and gets a total of 20. A good roll, but no enough.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STEALTH">STEALTH</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Agility &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Move &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You're skilled in going unnoticed. While using Stealth, you can move at your speed rank minus 1 with no penalty.
Faster than that, up to your full speed, you take a -2 circumstance penalty to your Stealth checks.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-HIDING">HIDING</h3>
<p>If you have cover or concealment, make a Stealth check, opposed by an observer's <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check, to hide and go unnoticed.</p>
<p>If others are aware of your presence, you can't use Stealth to remain undetected. You can run around a corner so you
are out of sight and then use Stealth, but others know which way you went. You can't hide at all if you have absolutely
no cover or concealment, since that means you are standing out in plain sight. Of course, if someone isn't looking
directly at you (you're sneaking up from behind, for example), then you have concealment relative to that person.</p>
<p>If you have the ability to cause a momentary distraction (such as a smoke pellet or flash bang) then you can make a
Stealth check while people are aware of you. When others turn their attention from you, make a Stealth check if you can
reach cover or concealment of some kind. Just like for Dodging area effects you must be close enough to the cover that
you can move there within 1 second (speed - 2). This check also has a -2 penalty because you have to move quickly.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TAILING">TAILING</h3>
<p>You can use Stealth to tail someone at your normal speed. This assumes you have some cover or concealment (crowds of
people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject is worried about being followed, he can make a <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check (opposed by your Stealth check) every time he changes course (goes around a
street corner, exits a building, and so on). If he is unsuspecting, he only gets one <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check for the scene. If the subject notices you, you may make a <a
href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> check, opposed by <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>. If you succeed, you manage to
pass off your presence as coincidence and can continue tailing. A failed <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> check,
or being noticed a second time, means the subject knows something is up and reacts accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-STRATEGY">STRATEGY</h2>
<span class="info-banner">Intellect</span>
<p>The ability to create plans, methods, or series of maneuvers for obtaining a specific goal or result (thank you <a

skilled in particular types of strategy such as those that follow.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MILITARY-STRATEGY">MILITARY STRATEGY</h3>
<p>This involves keeping track of your units, how to deploy them safely, where to position units and how to react to

<b>Expertise: Military</b> above.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BOARD-GAMES">BOARD GAMES</h3>
<p>Choose a specific board game. If you have at least one rank in it then you know the rules and have at least some
understanding on how to play effectively. The game (board, card or otherwise) must have strategy involved, so that
Strategy: Chess is appropriate but Strategy: Slap Jack is not.</p>
<p>Board Game strategy can be performed untrained only after you know how to play.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Survival">Survival</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Intellect &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> No</span>
<p>You can follow trails and track using your senses. If you are tracking a living being in an atmosphere, and are not
using any exotic senses, then smell (Olfactory) is the only trail directly left behind with a base DC of 0. You move at
your ground speed - 1, for DC +2 you can move at full speed. Foot prints can also be left behind directly under certain
circumstances, such as snow or mud, but may be false. Following a sent trail (if your sense of smell is acute) or
following correct foot prints only requires Tracking (Awe). Following foot prints that are not easy to see, get
interfered with by another's foot prints or are false is a higher DC of Tracking (Awe). Following footprints or a sent
trail can be done untrained.</p>
<p>For other clues, such as broken twigs, you see them as a result of something traveling but they might not be
helpful. This can't be done untrained. Following small clues of a trail might require periodic Perception (Awe) checks
and Tracking (Int).</p>

<h2 id="TOC-TECHNOLOGY">TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Ability</b>: Dexterity &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Trained Only?</b> Mostly &#8226; <b>Type</b> Manipulation with required tools (where applicable)</span>
<p>Technology covers operating, building, repairing, and generally working with technological devices and equipment.
Without the proper tools or equipment, you take a -2 penalty to Technology checks for highly unfavorable circumstances.
Various Expertise such as Criminal, Scientist, Engineer etc include technology but you can still take Technology as the
skill itself. Technology often uses Dexterity for applications.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SURVEILLANCE">SURVEILLANCE</h3>
<p>Is this investigation, technology, or knowledge? You can set up surveillance of a particular area, watching from a stationary location. The DC of the subject's <a
href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> check to evade your notice is equal to the result of your Investigation check. For
actively following a subject, see <b>Tailing</b> in the <b><a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a></b> skill.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-OPERATING">OPERATING</h3>
<p>Most routine operations of technological equipment don't require a skill check and can be done untrained. Using an
unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from simple (DC
0) to highly advanced (DC 15 or more).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BUILDING">BUILDING</h3>
<p>The difficulty and time required to make an item depends on its complexity, as shown on the <b>Building Items</b>
table. If your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item after the necessary time. If the check fails, you did
not produce a usable end result, and any time and materials are wasted. More than one degree of failure on the check may
produce an accident or other unfortunate side-effect at the GM's discretion.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-REPAIRING">REPAIRING</h3>
<p>You can also use Technology to repair damaged items, with a -5 to the DC to build the item and -2 to the time rank
required. So you can perform repairs on a complex item in eight hours (time rank 12) with a DC of 10. Failure on the
check means you spend the time, but make no progress. Two or more degrees of failure may indicate further damage to the
item or an accident similar to building it.</p>
<p>You can reduce the time rank to build or repair an item by 1 by taking a -5 penalty to your skill check.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-JURY-RIGGING">JURY-RIGGING</h3>
<p>You can also attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. This uses some rules for repairing (see above)
but repair DC is reduced by an additional 5 (for a
total of -10 to the DC to build the item), and allows you to make the Technology check as a standard action. However, a
jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem, and the repair only lasts until the end of the scene. The jury-rigged
item must be fully repaired thereafter, and cannot be jury-rigged again until it is fully repaired.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEMOLITIONS">DEMOLITIONS</h3>
<p>Careful placement of an explosive against a fixed structure can maximize damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
structure. This requires at least a minute and a DC 0 Technology check. The GM makes the check, so you don't know
exactly how well you have done until the explosive goes off. For every two full degrees of success, the explosive deals
+2 damage to the structure. Failure means the explosive does not go off as planned, while more than one degree of
failure means the charge goes off while you are setting it! In all cases, the explosive deals normal damage to all other
targets.</p>
<p>You can make an explosive device more difficult to disarm. To do so, choose a disarm difficulty class before making
your check to set the detonator. Your DC to set the detonator is the desired disarm DC. Failure means the explosive
fails to go off as planned. Two or more degrees of failure mean the explosive goes off as the detonator is being
installed!</p>
<p>Disarming an explosive also requires a Technology check. The DC is usually 0, unless the person who set the
detonator chose a higher disarm DC (previously). If you fail the check, you do not disarm the explosive. With more than
a degree of failure, the explosive goes off. Setting or disarming a detonator is a standard action.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-INVENTING">INVENTING</h3>
<p>You can use Technology to create inventions, temporary devices. See <a href="gadgets-gear/index.html#TOC-INVENTING">Gadgets &amp; Gear: Inventing</a>
for details.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SECURITY">SECURITY</h3>
<p>You can use Technology to disarm or sabotage various security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This
takes at least a minute, possibly longer, at the GM's discretion. The GM makes your Technology check secretly so you
don't necessarily know right away if you have succeeded. The Gamemaster sets the DC of the check based on the level of
security:</p>
<h3 class="table-name">TABLE: SECURITY LEVELS</h3>

<p>Failure on your skill check means nothing happens, but you can keep trying. More than one degree of failure sets off
the security or trap, if it is possible to do so. You may increase the DC by 2 for preventing your tampering from being
noticed.</p>
<p>The DCs listed for prisons are for the inmate to escape, the DC for an outside force breaking someone out might be
different depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Super-max security (aka a super-prison) is a maximum security prison designed to hold super villains. Power negation
is standard along with higher than maximum security protocols which makes escape impossible. It is not uncommon for such
a prison to also have a super hero (or super technology) to flawlessly monitor all activity or predict the next escape
attempt etc.</p>

href="#TOC-EXPERTISE">Expertise</a>: Riding skill, based on Agility, with the same guidelines as given for Vehicles
skill checks. At the Gamemaster's discretion, skills like <a href="#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a> can serve for riding
mounts (perhaps with a circumstance penalty), especially if riding is a fairly uncommon skill, as it is in the modern
world.</p>
