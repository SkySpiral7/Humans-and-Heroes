<div class="page-header-red">ACTION &amp; ADVENTURE</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<div style="padding:5px">Like the comics, this game is about action, so this section looks at the flow of the game and
how heroes accomplish their amazing feats, ranging from last-minute rescues and brilliant investigations to thrilling
battles against the forces of evil.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The section starts out with a look at action rounds, used to measure time when seconds count,
then moves on to the different challenges heroes face, followed by handling conflicts like super-powered battles. The
section concludes with information on the potential consequences, including various conditions imposed on heroes and the
hazards of the environment around them. This is followed by handling conflicts like super-powered battles, including
special actions, consequences of damage, and recovery from it.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">ACTION ROUNDS</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The <b>action round</b> (or simply <b>round</b>) is how this game breaks down time when things
like who goes first and how much each character can accomplish are important. A round represents about six seconds of
time in the game world.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">During a round, each character involved takes a <b>turn</b>, which is that character's
opportunity to do something. A character has an allotment of <b>actions</b>, used during that character's turn. Players
decide what their characters do on their turns, while the GM handles everyone else's turn.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-INITIATIVE">INITIATIVE</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">The order in which characters take their turns is determined by <b>initiative</b>. Base
initiative bonus is equal to the character's Agility rank. Many characters have advantages or powers that modify their
initiative, such as Improved Initiative. At the start of a conflict, roll an initiative check for each character:</div>
<div class="generated-class-5">3dF + initiative modifier</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The initiative check determines what order characters act in, counting down from highest check
result to lowest. Usually, the GM writes the names of the characters down in initiative order to move quickly from one
character to the next each round. You can also have all of the characters' names listed on index cards you can reshuffle
to fit the initiative order. If two characters have the same initiative result, they act in order of highest Dodge bonus
first, then highest Agility and highest Awareness. If there is still a tie, each tied player should roll dice, with the
highest roll going first. The GM may roll just once for an entire group of minions, giving them all the same
initiative.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If characters enter a conflict after it's begun, they roll initiative when they join-in and act
when their turn comes up in the existing order.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SURPRISE">SURPRISE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Some conflicts begin with one or more characters caught unaware or <b>surprised</b>. This is
typically because the character did not succeed on a Perception or other check and was therefore caught off-guard. Some
characters on a side can be surprised while others are not.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Any characters that are surprised get a -10 penalty to initiative checks and are vulnerable
until their turn (see <b>Conditions</b> in <a href="1-the-basics.html">The Basics</a>).</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-ACTION-TYPES">ACTION TYPES</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">The seven types of actions that effects require from slowest to fastest are slow, full,
standard, move, free, reaction, and triggered. In a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action,
or one full round action. A standard action can be traded for a move action instead. You can also perform as many free,
reactions, and triggered actions as your GM allows. But slow actions are not possible to use in combat.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Some situations (like the being surprised) and conditions (like being dazed) limit the actions
you can take during your turn.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SLOW-ACTION">SLOW ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This can't effectively be done in combat because it would take more than 10 rounds to perform.
These effects take various amounts of long time so that it can't be done during combat always taking at least a minute
but it could be an hour or more. The GM sets the specific time in cases where it matters, but it should be short enough
that you can do it between scenes in a game, but long enough that you effectively cannot do it during action time.
Although the GM may allow you to spend a victory point to quickly use the effect during action time as a power stunt
(changing the modifiers), if circumstances warrant it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Examples of such slow tasks are disassembling an entire car, reading a 400 page book, and
performing a play on stage (see <b>Quickness</b> in order to speed up such tasks). You might need access to a lab,
arsenal, spell-book, or other special equipment, or need to perform certain procedures or rituals. If the effect has
concentration duration then you might need to continue using any needed supplies each round it is maintained. There are
no powers that are slow by default and thus this would be a result of the flaw <a
href="6-powers/modifiers.html#TOC-SLOWER-ACTION">Slower Action</a>. Some effects, like <b>Affliction</b>, tend to be
worthless when slow.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FULL-ROUND-ACTION">FULL ROUND ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You may trade a standard action and a move action for a full round action. <b>Variable</b> is
the only effect that takes a full round action by default but other effects may be slowed down to this action with the
flaw <a href="6-powers/modifiers.html#TOC-SLOWER-ACTION">Slower Action</a>.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STANDARD-ACTION">STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A standard action allows you to do something. You can make an attack, use a skill, advantage,
or power, or perform other similar actions. During a combat round, you can take a standard action and a move
action.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MOVE-ACTION">MOVE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A move action allows you to move your speed or perform an action taking a similar amount of
time, such as draw or stow a weapon or other object, stand up, pick up an object, or perform some equivalent action (see
the <b>Actions in Combat Table</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can take a move action in place of a standard action. For example, rather than moving your
speed and attacking you can stand up and move your speed (two move actions), draw a weapon and climb (two move actions),
or pick up an object and stow it (two move actions). You can also make a DC 5 Athletics check as a free action to run
faster: one or more degree of success increases your ground speed rank by +1 for one round.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FREE-ACTION">FREE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Free actions consume very little time and, over the span of the round, their impact is so minor
they are considered to take no real time at all. You can perform one or more free actions while taking another action.
For instance, dropping an object, dropping to a prone position, speaking a sentence or two, and ceasing to concentrate
on maintaining a power are all free actions.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-REACTION">REACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A reaction is something that happens in response to something else, like a reflex. Like free
actions, reactions take so little time they're considered free. The difference between the two is a free action can only
be done on the character's turn but reactions can be done on anyone's turn. <b>Luck Control</b> is the only power with a
default action of reaction (see the <a href="6-powers/modifiers.html#TOC-FASTER-ACTION">Faster Action</a> modifier for
others). Active defenses are reactions.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-TRIGGERED">TRIGGERED</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Triggered effects you may activate as a reaction but it can also activate automatically, even
if you are stunned or incapacitated, based on any conditions you set see <a
href="6-powers/modifiers.html#TOC-FASTER-ACTION">Faster Action</a> for details. As a reaction you may also choose for it
not to activate and thus it is also <b>Selective</b>. Some powers and other traits are usable as triggered but only with
the <a href="6-powers/modifiers.html#TOC-FASTER-ACTION">Faster Action</a> modifier. Fortitude and Will defense checks
act as triggered effects but are not since you can't set any conditions etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a Triggered effect is always active and is close range then it doesn't miss when either you
touch something or something touches you (by default the floor is excluded).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-NO-ACTION">NO ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Finally, some things players are called upon to do are not considered actions at all, as they
involve no action on the part of the characters. Toughness for example will occur even for inanimate objects or dead
characters. Thinking takes No Action if the character is able to do so (must be conscious).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ACTION-LIMITATIONS">ACTION LIMITATIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">There are certain limitations for balance reasons that ignore what actions are taken to perform
a task. They are as follows:</div>
<ul>
<li><div style="padding:5px">After you attack you can't attack again until your next turn. This includes any effect with the <b>Attack</b> modifier but <b>Affects Others</b> and <b>Enhanced Trait</b> have no limitation.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">After a character is revived (from <b>Immortality</b> or <b>Healing</b>) they can't be revived again until 8 minutes have passed (time rank 7). This would be 80 turns so that it can't be done in combat.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">After you have moved twice you can't move again until your next turn. This includes movement type effects and the natural ability to walk etc.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px">After a character is targeted by <b>Healing</b> and recovers at least 1 HP they can't recover any more HP by any other <b>Healing</b> effects until their next turn. <b>Regeneration</b>, natural healing, and other forms of healing are not limited.</div></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-TAKING-YOUR-TURN">TAKING YOUR TURN</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">When it is your turn in the initiative order, you declare what actions your character will
perform, and they are resolved in order.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STARTING-YOUR-TURN">STARTING YOUR TURN</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The Gamemaster informs you when it is your turn. When you start your turn, you should:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">End effects that last "until the start of your next turn".</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-TAKING-ACTIONS">TAKING ACTIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You get a standard and a move action each turn. You can exchange your standard action for an
additional move action, allowing you to perform two move actions. You can also perform as many free actions on your turn
as you wish.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ORDER-OF-ACTIONS">ORDER OF ACTIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You perform your actions in any order that you wish, but you cannot normally "split" your
actions. So, for example, although you can move (move action) and then attack (standard action) or attack and then move,
you cannot move half your distance, attack, and then move the other half unless you have some special trait that allows
you to do so.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-EXTRA-ACTION">EXTRA ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can use extra effort in order to take an additional standard or move action on your turn
(see <b>Extra Effort</b>).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ENDING-YOUR-TURN">ENDING YOUR TURN</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">At the end of your turn, you should:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">End any effects that last "until the end of your turn".</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Make any necessary resistance checks to recover from ongoing effects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Inform the Gamemaster and other players that your turn is finished, allowing the next character
in the initiative order to go.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">CHALLENGES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">In game terms, a <b>challenge</b> is an action or series of actions where players are called
upon to make checks of their characters' traits, but which do not involve direct conflict, such as fighting. Some
challenges are quick and involve only a single character, such as a hero making a daring leap or acrobatic maneuver,
while others are more involved and require the efforts of a whole team, such as clearing all of the people out of a
burning building or searching the entire city (or world!) for an escaped criminal.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The challenges given in this section are by no means the only possible ones. They simply cover
the major "building blocks" Gamemasters can use to create challenges in their own games and offer examples. Feel free to
come up with your own challenges to test the heroes' abilities and give the players an opportunity to come up with
clever plans of their own.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CHALLENGES-AND-INITIATIVE">CHALLENGES AND INITIATIVE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Challenges may or may not involve initiative checks, depending on the nature of the
challenge.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If all of the characters get a turn and it does not particularly matter who goes first, then
the Gamemaster can dispense with initiative for the challenge. For example, if the heroes all have to leap across a
chasm, then it is a challenge they must all complete, and it does not particularly matter which of them goes first or
last in doing so (since their actions are all virtually simultaneous).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">With other challenges, it does matter who goes first, particular when the challenge is timed in
some fashion. So, for example, if the GM determines that part of a burning building will collapse after the first round,
initiative may be checked to see which heroes go before the collapse and who does not quite act fast enough. The same
may be true of other traps or hazards, which can have initiative ranks of their own.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CHALLENGE-SEQUENCES">CHALLENGE SEQUENCES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A <b>challenge sequence</b> is made up of a series of checks rather than a simple set of one or
two. It represents a more involved or detailed challenge for the heroes. So, whereas a simple challenge might involve
breaking down a door or figuring out a lock, a challenge sequence could be a lengthy investigation, searching for
someone who has gone missing, or convincing a non-player character of the heroes' good intentions. It can involve
several checks of the same trait, or multiple traits, such as a Persuasion check to get the heroes on good terms with
the King of Atlantis, an Expertise check to explain the particular danger the kingdom faces, and an Insight check to
realize the king's advisor has something other than the best interests of the kingdom and royal family at heart.
Similarly, heroes might make Perception checks to pick up on particular clues, Investigate checks to gather and analyze
them, and Expertise checks to figure out the villain's riddle behind them before it is too late.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CHALLENGES-AND-CONSEQUENCES">CHALLENGES AND CONSEQUENCES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Challenges typically have some reward for success (usually moving on to the next part of the
adventure) and some consequence for failure. The latter might be missing a vital clue or otherwise being unable to stop
a villain's scheme. This may make later parts of the adventure more difficult for your heroes. Other consequences might
include particular conditions (see <b>Conditions</b> in <a href="1-the-basics.html">The Basics</a>); for example, failing a
wilderness survival challenge may result in the heroes suffering from fatigue or exhaustion. Failing a challenge to
cross a chasm could mean the hero falls and suffers damage. Failing a challenge to overcome a trap could mean the heroes
are even incapacitated, falling into the villain's clutches! The GM decides the consequences of failing a particular
challenge based on the challenge and the needs of the story.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-ENVIRONMENTAL-HAZARDS">ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Not all of the hazards heroes face come from supervillains. Sometimes the environment itself
can be a danger, particularly when villains try to use it to their advantage. Heroes end up in a lot of dangerous places
and deal with less than ideal conditions. This section details some of the hazards heroes may face.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-LIGHT-AND-DARKNESS">LIGHT AND DARKNESS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Criminals often lurk in the darkness, and many crimes take place at night. Most cities are lit
well enough, but sometimes heroes run into areas where it's difficult to see. Poorly lit areas provide concealment.
Characters with Counters Concealment (Darkness) Senses or other appropriate Senses effects can ignore concealment
penalties for poor lighting.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-HEAT-AND-COLD">HEAT AND COLD</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Intense heat and cold wear down characters, while prolonged exposure to the elements can be
extremely dangerous.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters in hot or cold conditions must make Fortitude checks (DC 0, +1 per previous check)
to avoid becoming fatigued. Fatigued characters who fail a check become exhausted, then incapacitated, at which point
the character's condition becomes dying after another failed Fortitude check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">How often characters have to make Fortitude checks depends on the conditions. Once an hour for
uncomfortable heat or cold (a hot summer day or cold winter day), once per 10 minutes for intense heat or cold (a
blazing desert or Arctic conditions), once a minute for extreme heat or cold like the edge of a volcano or an arctic
winter storm. Checks are made at the end of each period of exposure. Truly intense heat or cold--such as a blast furnace
or touching liquid nitrogen--inflicts direct damage like an attack.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters with the appropriate <b>Immunity</b> do not need to make Fortitude checks for
natural temperatures (up to intense temperatures). Additionally there are other things that factor into the temperature
exposure checks such as: heavy or light clothing, drinking plenty of water, physical activity, direct sunlight,
etc. The GM will determine the DCs and how frequently the checks occur based on these kinds of things.
The Gamemaster may also assign conditions such as sunburn and frostbite as appropriate.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STARVATION-AND-THIRST">STARVATION AND THIRST</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Heroes can go without water for a day. After this, they need to make a Fortitude check (DC 0,
+1 per previous check) each hour to avoid a level of fatigue. Heroes can go without food for three days. After this,
they must make a Fortitude check (DC 0, +1 per previous check) every 4 hours to avoid fatigue. The character cannot recover
until he gets water or food. Heroes with <b>Immunity</b> to Starvation can go an unlimited time without food or
water. In all other cases a character will die after either 3 days without water or 7 days without food (do not roll
a Fortitude check since it is impossible to pass). This makes the maximum DCs that can be survived DC 48 without water
and DC 24 without food.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Factors such as heat and physical activity may affect these sustenance checks as determined by the
GM. A character fat enough might make it 8 days without food but no more since fat can't store everything a body needs (fat
doesn't affect dehydration time at all).
Failing one check will affect the other since it will make you fatigued. Some food can substitute for water
(specifically watermelon) but water can never count as food.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SUFFOCATION">SUFFOCATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters can hold their breath for ten rounds (one minute) plus a number of rounds equal to
twice their Stamina. After that time they must make a Fortitude check (DC 0) each round to continue holding their
breath. The DC increases by +1 for each previous success. Failure on the Fortitude check means the character becomes
incapacitated and on the following round the character is dying. A dying character cannot stabilize until able to breathe
again. Heroes with <b>Immunity</b> to Suffocation can go an unlimited time without air.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FALLING">FALLING</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A fall inflicts damage rank equal to (fallen distance - your size)*2 with a maximum of 18. A
fall with a damage rank of 0 or less, such as a fall of 6 feet or less, inflicts no damage. You are prone at the end of
a fall if you fell accidentally or if you failed the Toughness check (ie took any damage). The GM may increase the
maximum fall damage based on air pressure, your mass, and your aerodynamic properties. For reference an average human
falling from an airplane reaches a maximum speed of 120 MPH (speed rank 6). Falling into or onto a dangerous surface may cause
additional damage, at the GM's discretion.</div>

<div style="padding:5px">Radiation in the comic books often causes mutations or triggers latent powers in those exposed

an excellent opportunity for a complication.</div>

initial Fortitude check against (DC of the radiation's rank) and an additional check each day. Radiation sickness is
typically a <b>Weaken</b> Stamina effect, but may include other effects, including <b>Damage</b> resisted by Fortitude.
At the GM's discretion, radiation exposure can lead to other effects, such as damage to a hero's power ranks (causing a

<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-VACUUM">VACUUM</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The primary hazards of the vacuum of space are lack of air and exposure to unfiltered ionizing
radiation.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">On the third round of exposure to vacuum, a character must succeed on a Fortitude check (DC 10)
each round or suffer from aeroembolism ("the bends"). A failed check means excruciating pain as small air bubbles form
in the creature's bloodstream; the creature is stunned and remains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure. Two
or more degrees of failure impose the incapacitated condition.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though holding one's breath in vacuum damages
the lungs. A character who attempts to hold his breath must make a Fortitude check (DC 5) every round; the DC increases
by 1 each round, and on a successful check the character loses a rank of Stamina (from the pressure on the linings of
his lungs). If the check fails, or when the character simply stops holding his breath, he begins to suffocate: the next
round, he becomes incapacitated. The following round, he's dying and cannot stabilize until returned to a normal
atmosphere.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Unfiltered radiation bombards any character trapped in the vacuum of space without protective
gear, see <b>Radiation</b>, previously (damage 6).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Heroes able to ignore the effects of deep space must have <b>Immunity</b> to suffocation and
vacuum and <b>Resistance</b> to radiation, at a minimum. See the <b>Immunity</b> and <b>Resistance</b> effects in <a
href="6-powers.html">Powers</a> for details.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">RELATIVE SIZE RULES</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">There are many impacts of being a different size in addition to the ability changes mentioned in
<b>Growth</b> and <b>Shrinking</b>. These impacts are listed here.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">All distances (of all effects), such as speed and range (include close range distance aka
reach), are determined by size but are absolute instead of relative. For clarification: absolute size bonuses and
penalties are those with independent quantities such as Strength and relative size bonuses and penalties are those that
can only be determined when compared to another size such as Intimidation and Stealth. Relative size bonuses apply to:
Dodge, Senses, Intimidation, Stealth, Search and some other skills.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Dodge</b>: Instead of a smaller target gaining Dodge the attacker loses attack, in this way
something small is harder to hit even when defenseless including inanimate objects. When determining power level
calculate Dodge as though the attack penalty was instead a Dodge bonus. This bonus or penalty is equal to (target's size
- your size) that is to say when attacking a smaller object you get a penalty and when attacking a larger object you get
a bonus. Parry, on the other hand, does not change anything: no defense or attack bonus or penalty.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Attack Area</b>: If the difference in size is significant then the small character must
Dodge as though the attack was an area, for example: a fly swatter has a 6 inch diameter making it Distance rank -5 but
a fly is size rank -10 (0.35 inches) despite being close combat the fly can't parry this attack and must dodge. Anything
long range is still Dodged as normal and generally anything with an attack radius equal to the size of the character
must be dodged. The GM has the final say in deciding if an attack can be Parried, otherwise it must be dodged as an area
attack.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sense</b>: Some targets may be too small to sense except by <b>microscopic</b> senses. The
GM will determine the DC required to be able to sense it if possible.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Skill</b>: Some skills like Intimidation, Stealth, and Search will get a bonus or penalty
based on size. Such as +1 Intimidation per size greater than target and +1 Stealth per size smaller than observer.
Larger characters may be able to search an area faster but may get a penalty if the desired object is too small for them
to find. Climbing is based on base movement speed (which larger characters have more of). There may be other skills that
depend on size as determined by the GM case by case. Here are two absolute skill bonuses: -1 Climbing penalty per mass (but not
size) decreased to a maximum of base speed and +1 to resist Trip attempts per mass increase.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Grab</b>: The grab bonus or penalty is equal to (your size - their size) (maximum limited by
PL). If you are much larger than the defender so that your hand is as big as they are then you can grab and hold them
with only one hand (same as <b>Improved Grab</b>). You are not hindered or vulnerable due to grabbing a character that
fits in one hand. If the held character isn't touching the ground (and can't <b>fly</b> etc) then they do not get a
resistance check when you drag them.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">CONFLICTS</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A <b>conflict</b> is when two or more characters go up against each other, typically in a fight
of some sort. Conflict between heroes and villains is a prime part of the game and a big element of the fun, just like
the colorful and spectacular fights in the superhero comic books.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-ATTACKS">ATTACKS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">An <b>attack check</b> represents an attempt to hit a target with an attack. When you make an
attack check, roll the dice and add your bonus with that attack. If your result equals or exceeds the target's defense
check, your attack hits and may have some effect.</div>
<div class="generated-class-5">Attack Check = 3dF + attack bonus vs. defense check</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CRITICAL-HITS">CRITICAL HITS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you make an attack check and all 3 Fudge dice come up as +1 (for a total of +3 before
attack bonuses), you automatically hit, regardless of your target's defense, and you score a critical threat. The hit might also
be a critical hit. To find out if it's a critical hit, determine if the attack check total
is equal to or greater than the target's defense check. If so, it is a critical hit. If not, the attack still hits, but
as a normal attack, not a critical hit.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Conversely, if all 3 Fudge dice come up as -1 (for a total of -3
before attack bonuses) this causes the attack to always miss, regardless of your total result.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-EFFECTS-OF-A-CRITICAL-HIT">EFFECTS OF A CRITICAL HIT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A critical hit can have one of the following three effects, chosen by the player when the
critical hit is determined:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Increased Effect</b>: The critical hit increases the difficulty to resist the attack's
effect by +1. Against a minion, this bypasses the resistance check entirely; the minion automatically receives the
highest degree of the attack's effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Added Effect</b>: The critical hit adds another effect onto the attack, but its effective
rank is 0, so the resistance DC 3dF+0. The added effect can be anything the player can reasonably describe and justify
as adjunct to the original effect: an <b>Affliction</b> (useful for all sorts of "gut checks," blows to the head or
vitals, etc.), <b>Dazzle</b> (blood in the eyes, boxing the ears, etc.), or <b>Weaken</b>, to name a few. The GM decides
if the effect suits the circumstances of the attack. The target makes resistance checks against the attack's initial and
added effects separately.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-HEALTH-POINTS">HEALTH POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When damaged after resistance is rolled (see
<a href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/damage-attack.html">Damage</a> effect) if you
succeeded no damage is taken otherwise you lose HP (Health Points) equal to the difference. Maximum HP for characters
(including constructs) is always equal to 6 and can't be increased, decreased, or weakened. There is an exception for
Minions who always have a maximum HP of 1. Battlesuits while in use act as armor in that the person inside will lose HP
with damage even though the resistance check is based on the battlesuit's toughness. This is done so that characters who
put every point into a battlesuit will have no HP advantage or disadvantage during combat.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs have HP because they are characters but Inanimate objects do not have HP. Damaging
objects (anything without HP) is explained below (see DAMAGING OBJECTS).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">There are certain conditions imposed by HP that are gained when entering the HP range and
removed when leaving. The conditions can't be removed by any other means. Having HP greater than 1 imposes no
conditions. If you have 1 or less HP you are subject to minion rules with an exception that if your maximum HP is greater
than 1 then you are still able to score critical hits against non-minions and failure doesn't automatically result in the worst degree.
If you have exactly 0 HP then you are
staggered; this does not replace any other kind of staggered because removal is different. At HP -3 or less you are
dead (which removes all other conditions). While in the HP range of less than 0 but not dead you have either the Dying
or Stabilized conditions both are removed when leaving this HP range (see Conditions for more details). When first
entering negative HP (unless already Dead) you gain Dying.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Whenever a character dies for any reason, their HP becomes -3. See <a
href="#TOC-DEATH">Death</a> for more details.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STRENGTH-AND-DAMAGE">STRENGTH AND DAMAGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Strength provides a "built-in" <b>Damage</b> effect: the ability to hit things! You can apply
effect modifiers to the damage your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even an Area effect! You can also have
Alternate Effects for your Strength <b>Damage</b>; see the <b>Alternate Effect</b> modifier for details. Like other
<b>Damage</b> effects, a character's Strength <b>Damage</b> is close range and instant duration by default.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you choose, a <b>Damage</b> effect can be Strength-based--something like a melee
weapon--allowing your Strength <b>Damage</b> to add to it. You add your Strength and <b>Damage</b> ranks together when
determining the rank of the attack. Any modifiers applied to your <b>Damage</b> must also apply to your Strength rank if
its bonus damage is to benefit from them. However, any decrease in your Strength reduces the amount you can add to your
<b>Damage</b>, and negative Strength subtracts from your <b>Damage</b>! Likewise, anything that prevents you from
exerting your Strength also stops you from using a Strength-based <b>Damage</b> effect. If you can't swing your fist,
you can't swing a sword, either. On the other hand, a laser blade does the same damage whether you can exert your
Strength with it or not.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RECOVERY">RECOVERY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Living targets recover 1 HP every 8 hours. Being restful (such as sleeping) doubles recovery
rate. With a skill DC 5 Medical Treatment (Awe or Int) check someone may help you recover for that day which doubles
recovery rate. These two circumstances can stack so that a person may recover 4 HP overnight (8 hours) or 12 HP over a
day. Tenderized penalties are removed once per hour in the same fashion and at the same time. See <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/healing-general.html">Healing</a> and <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/regeneration-defense.html">Regeneration</a> effects for a speedy recovery.
Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as complications (see <b>Lasting Injuries</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs and objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage unless they have an
effect like <a href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/regeneration-defense.html">Regeneration</a>. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the <b>Technology</b> skill when repairing damaged objects. For a construct
to automatically regain HP at the same rate as a living organism is a 1 point feature, whether or not it is considered natural is
determined by the description and the Gamemaster.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-LASTING-INJURIES">LASTING INJURIES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Mutants and Masterminds was designed to emulate the superhero comic books (Humans and Heroes is
designed for versatility), so characters generally bounce back pretty fast from taking serious beatings, and there is
little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter,
set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in severe injuries that take a
considerable amount of time to heal; in comics, and most things with frequent combat, most characters just shake it off
and are all better by the next scene.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">By default there are no lasting injuries. If the Gamemaster wants or is using lasting injuries
see <a href="11-supplementary-rules.html">Supplementary Rules: Lasting Injuries</a>.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEATH">DEATH</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Death causes a character to lose all victory points and causes <b>Power Loss</b> to all of that
character's powers except <b>Immortality</b> (ones that are not permanent or continuous duration would end anyway due to
lack of maintenance). Note a special exception: if a <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/variable-general.html">Continuous Variable</a> provides <b>Immortality</b>
then death will cause a <b>Power Loss</b> to all other powers provided by <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/variable-general.html">Variable</a> but not to <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/variable-general.html">Variable</a> itself or to the provided
<b>Immortality</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">All powers that were provided by affects others end unless it can also affect objects (this is
because your corpse is an object and not a character). Death never causes the duration of <b>Immortality</b> to end by
definition, but other permanent or continuous duration powers might end as determined by the Gamemaster whether or not
they are based on physical properties. The powers <b>Extra Limbs</b>, <b>Enhanced Toughness</b>, and <b>Growth</b> often
remain after death while <b>Morph</b> most commonly ends upon death.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it's not so
much rare as it is temporary. The tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it
is clich&eacute;, with various stories and characters poking fun at it. But accidental death is still possible, if the
Gamemaster wants to prevent this the Gamemaster can require all damage to be <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/damage-attack.html#TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">non-lethal</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that minions can be easily killed off with a successful attack. While heroes in a
four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down by the dozens in gritty
Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit the story. The greater
"resilience" of main characters is not because they are physically any different or tougher, just that they are
literally more important to the story of the game (aka plot armor).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-POWER-LOSS">POWER LOSS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power Loss</b> is simply whenever a character loses a power but this can occur in several
ways. When a power is lost it's duration ends and reversible affects are not reversed by default. <b>Power Loss</b> is
the only way to turn off permanent duration effects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power Loss</b> drains the usage of all effects that have ammunition except those ones that
the Gamemaster has deemed physical ammunition (ammunition that is per reload is generally physical). If a power is
keeping a record, that record will be reset upon <b>Power Loss</b>. For example, the example power <b>Evolutionary
Defense</b> keeps a record of every descriptor that has targeted you so far and its rank. There are actually three ways
for a power to maintain a record: in your memory, in itself, and independently. If the record is stored in your memory
it is unaffected by <b>Power Loss</b> but requires a memory check each time and can be forgotten or altered. If the
record is tracked by the power itself then it it much more reliable and convenient but is erased by <b>Power Loss</b>.
The last option is to take the advantage <b>Persistent Information</b> which acts as though the record was stored in the
power but the record is unaffected by <b>Power Loss</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">There are many ways for <b>Power Loss</b> to occur. Death causes a <b>Power Loss</b> to all
powers of that character except the ones that the Gamemaster has deemed physical and <b>Immortality</b> (and any <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/variable-general.html">Continuous Variable</a> that provides the
<b>Immortality</b>). It is possible for a complication to cause <b>Power Loss</b>, further details depend on the
complication description. If you have a group of powers with an activation flaw then deactivation causes <b>Power
Loss</b> to each power within that group. If the duration of <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/variable-general.html">Variable</a> power ends (or is countered) then there
is <b>Power Loss</b> for all powers that it provided. A permanent effect goes through <b>Power Loss</b> when it is
countered (the power will automatically come back during the owner's next turn).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The most notable <b>Power Loss</b> is from a complication because it prevents the use of the
power for as long as the complication dictates.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RANGE">RANGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and perception. A <b>close</b> attack can
only affect a target you can physically reach, by touch or wielding a melee weapon, for example. A <b>ranged</b> attack
can affect a target at a distance, while a <b>perception</b> attack can hit a target you are able to accurately perceive
automatically without need for an attack check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A ranged attack has a short range of distance rank 0 (30 ft), at which it has no penalties.
Medium range is short range +1 (distance rank 1 = 60 ft), at this distance the attack check has a -1 circumstance
modifier. Long range is short range +2 (distance rank 2 = 120 ft), at this distance the attack check has a -2
circumstance modifier. Ranged attacks cannot go beyond long range; a target further away is out of range and cannot be
attacked.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">These are generally the only significant distinctions in distance. At the basic level, the game
system does not focus on tracking exact distances between combatants, apart from determining if they are adjacent (and
therefore within close range) and whether or not they can perceive each other (and are therefore within perception
range). The rest is left for the GM to describe and adjudicate as desired.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-PERCEPTION-AND-AREA-EFFECTS">PERCEPTION AND AREA EFFECTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Perception and Area effects do not require attack checks, they automatically affect a given
target or area (see the <b>Area</b> extra in <a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a>). Because of this, these attacks cannot
have critical success or failure, nor do modifiers affecting the attack check--including various maneuvers--affect
them.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CONCEALMENT">CONCEALMENT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">To attack a target, you first have to have some idea of where to aim your attack. If you can
perceive something with an accurate sense (such as sight) then you can target it with an attack. If you cannot clearly
perceive the target, then it has <b>concealment</b> from you.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Partial Concealment</b> applies a -1 circumstance penalty to your attack check for not being
able to clearly perceive your target. It includes conditions like dim lighting, foli-age, heavy precipitation, fog,
smoke, and the like. At least 50% of the target needs to be difficult to make out for this to apply.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Total Concealment</b> applies a -2 circumstance penalty to your attack check for not being
able to perceive the target at all, presuming the attacker even knows (or guesses) the right area to target. It includes
conditions like total darkness, heavy smoke or fog, and so forth.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-COVER">COVER</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Targets may also hide behind obstructions to gain <b>cover</b> against your attacks.
Obstructions that do not physically block attacks but simply make the target harder to perceive--such as lighting, fog,
or foliage--provide concealment rather than cover.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Partial Cover</b> applies a -1 circumstance penalty to your attack check. It generally means
about half of the target is behind cover, such as around a corner, behind a tree or pillar, or a low wall.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Total Cover</b> applies a -2 circumstance penalty to your attack check, with three-quarters
or more of the target behind cover, like a narrow window, or crouched behind a wall.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a target is completely behind cover, then you cannot attack that target (although you can
attack the cover itself). Even if you can see through the cover you can only attack the cover unless your attack
can ignore cover (see <a href="6-powers/modifiers.html">Modifiers</a>
<b>Indirect</b>, <b>Ricochet</b>, and <b>Area</b>), Perception range doesn't automatically ignore cover.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Cover also grants a circumstance bonus to Dodge resistance checks against area effects equal to
its penalty to attack checks, so long as the target has cover with respect to the origin point of the effect. So someone
behind total cover also gains a +2 to Dodge checks against area effects.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MINION-RULES">MINION RULES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Minions</b> are minor characters subject to special rules in combat, and generally easier to
defeat than normal characters. Villains often employ hordes of minions against heroes. The following rules apply to
minions:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Minions cannot score critical hits against non-minions. This only applies to actual minions, not
characters with 1 HP.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Non-minions can make attack checks against minions as routine checks (only against active
defenses not passive).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a minion uses <b>Nullify</b> or <b>Weaken</b> against a Non-minion they are considered to
have rolled a rolled a -3 instead of rolling but this is not considered a critical failure.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a Non-minion uses <b>Nullify</b> (but not <b>Weaken</b>) against a minion they are
considered to have rolled a +3 instead of rolling but this is not considered a critical success.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a minion fails a resistance check, the minion suffers the worst degree of the effect.
This only applies to actual minions, not characters with 1 HP.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RESISTANCE">RESISTANCE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A successful attack has some <b>effect</b> on the target. Typically this is an effect from the
<a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a>, such as <b>damage</b> or <b>Affliction</b>. The effect has a rank, used to determine
a difficulty class for the target's resistance check.</div>
<div class="generated-class-5">Resistance Difficulty = power check (3dF + rank) + modifiers</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The target of the attack makes a resistance check against the effect to determine what, if
anything, happens.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ONGOING-EFFECTS">ONGOING EFFECTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Some effects are not resisted just once, but multiples times. The later resistance checks
represent how fast the target is able to "shake off" the effect. Make a resistance check for the target of an ongoing
effect at the end of each of the target's turns. A successful check ends the effect and removes conditions imposed by
it. A failure means the effect's conditions persist, as given in the effect's description.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Your hero was hit by a Affliction effect, leaving him blinded. At the end of his turn, he makes a Fortitude resistance check against the effect's DC to try and shake it off, but missed the check by 2. His next turn, still blind, he stumbles and tries to strike the foe taunting him. At the end of his turn, he makes another resistance check. success! He ends the Affliction effect and removes the blinded condition. Next turn, the villain had better watch out!</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CONDITIONS">CONDITIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A failed resistance check against an attack imposes one or more <b>conditions</b> on the
target, depending on the type of effect and the degree of failure. See the effect description and the <b>Conditions</b>
section of <a href="1-the-basics.html">The Basics</a> for more on the various conditions.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-ACTIONS">ACTIONS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">The most common actions characters take during conflicts are listed and described here. The GM
should use these as guidelines for dealing with unusual actions players may choose for their characters, basing them on
the existing action descriptions. The actions listed can have modifiers applied just like strength's damaging attack in
both cases you still have a copy of the original after buying and appling modifiers. However the only two actions listed
below that can have modifiers are: Grab and Trip. You can't make these actions any faster (via the <b>Faster Action</b>
extra) and the Gamemaster has the final say on which modifiers are allowed to be used for those actions.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-AID---STANDARD-ACTION">AID - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If you are in position to melee attack an opponent, you can attempt to aid an ally engaged in
melee with that opponent as a standard action. This is like a team check (see <b>Team Checks</b> in <a
href="1-the-basics.html">The Basics</a>): You make an attack check against DC 0. If you succeed, you don't actually hit or
affect the opponent, but success grants your ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus on an attack check against that opponent
or a +1 circumstance bonus to Defense against that opponent (your choice) until the end of your ally's next turn. Three
or more degrees of success grant a +2 bonus. Failure does nothing but two or more degrees of failure (if possible)
forces the ally to take a -1 penalty.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-AIM---STANDARD-ACTION">AIM - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">By taking a standard action to aim and line up an attack, you get a bonus to hit when you make
the attack against that target. If you're making a close attack, or a ranged attack at close range, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on your
attack check. If you're making a ranged attack from a greater distance, you get a +1 circumstance bonus.
You can't attack the target the same turn you start aiming even if you have enough actions left.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are vulnerable while aiming and you must take a free action to maintain your aim
each turn (before you make your attack). To start and maintain an aim you must be able to accurately sense your target.
If you are unable to maintain the aim, you lose its benefit.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Once you aim, your next action that is a move action or slower must be to attack that target. Taking a
different action or attacking a different target spoils your aim and you lose the bonus.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ATTACK---STANDARD-ACTION">ATTACK - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">With a standard action, you can make an attack check against any opponent within the attack's
range. This action represents the using of a power that is an attack, for using other effects see their required action.
Only one attack can be made per turn. If the attack is an area effect or perception range, no attack check is needed. It
affects the area or target automatically.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CHARGE---STANDARD-ACTION">CHARGE - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You rush forward to attack. You move your speed rank in a mode of movement available to you in
a relatively straight line towards your target. At the end of your movement, you perform a close attack against your
opponent with a -1 circumstance penalty to the attack check. The attack used can't be slower than a standard
action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can combine a charge action with a move action, allowing you to move up to twice your speed
(your speed rank as a move action, then your speed rank again when you charge). Charging counts as both a movement and
an attack.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CRAWL---MOVE-ACTION">CRAWL - MOVE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">While prone, you can only move by crawling. You crawl at your normal ground speed -1 rank (or
half your normal speed).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters with the <a
href="6-powers/effects/effect-descriptions/movement-movement.html#TOC-SLITHERING">Slither</a> effect of Movement crawl
at their normal ground speed. See page for details.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEFEND---STANDARD-ACTION">DEFEND - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Rather than attacking, you focus on defense. You can't attack this turn if you use this action,
just as though this counted as an attack. Choose an active defense, until your next turn any check of that defense has better
results. If the dice sum is less than 1 (before adding defense ranks) then use 1 instead, just as if you spent a victory
point. The attacker must equal or exceed your opposed check result in order to hit you (as normal). The active defense
that you did not choose to defend with functions normally.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DELAY---NO-ACTION">DELAY - NO ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you delay, you choose to take your turn later in the initiative order. You must delay your
entire turn. You cannot delay if you have already taken an action on your turn, or if you are unable to take
actions.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">At any point after any other character in the conflict has acted, you can choose to take your
turn. Your initiative moves into the new place in the order where you act, and you take your normal allocation of
actions. If you do not act before your initiative comes up in the next round, your turn ends, you lose your delayed
turn, and your initiative remains where it is.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Beneficial effects lasting until the end of your turn end when you choose to delay, but harmful
effects that last until the end of your turn in which you act. Like-wise, you do not make resistance checks until after
you have taken your turn, so delaying can draw out some effects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">However you can't delay your turn indefinitely: if initiative is rolled each round then you
must take your turn before the next initiative is rolled. If initiative is only rolled once at the start of combat and
you delay your turn so that it ends up in the same initiative order then you have two turns in a row but the first one
is special because it can't be delayed and you can't take any actions (not even free ones). The special turn occurs so
that effects that trigger each turn, such as overcoming an <b>Affliction</b>, will trigger the same number of times. The
turn that follows the special turn is ordinary in every way and it can be delayed.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DISARM---STANDARD-ACTION">DISARM - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You attempt to knock a loosely attached or held item--such as a weapon or device--off of the
opponent or out of an opponent's grasp. You may Disarm using any attack at the Gamemaster's discretion based on
descriptor: the attack must be able to knock the object away but not destroy it (see <b>Smash</b> below for destroying
objects). Make an attack check against the defender with a -1 penalty or a -2 penalty if hand held. If you attempt to
disarm with a ranged attack, you receive an additional -1 penalty. If your attack succeeds, make an opposed check of
your attack's damage against the defender's Strength for a held item or against the binding's Toughness for attached
items. If you win, the item is dropped or shot off. If you made the disarm unarmed, you can grab the object as a free
action.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DROP-AN-ITEM---FREE-ACTION">DROP AN ITEM - FREE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Dropping a held item is a free action (although dropping or throwing an item with the intention
of hitting something with it is a standard attack action).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DROP-PRONE---FREE-ACTION">DROP PRONE - FREE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Dropping to a prone position is a free action, although getting up requires a move action (see
<b>Stand</b>).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ESCAPE---MOVE-ACTION">ESCAPE - MOVE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You attempt to escape from a successful grab (see <b>Grab</b>). Make a skill check (Athletics
to break out or Acrobatics or Escape Artist (Dex) etc to slip out) against the routine check of your opponent's Strength
or grab effect rank. If you succeed, you end the grab but your normal ground speed is reduced by 1 during this turn
(other actions including movement powers are not affected). If you fail, you are still grabbed.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-GRAB---STANDARD-ACTION">GRAB - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You attempt to grab a target. If you use a grabbing effect it will list a number to use as a
substitute for Strength, usually equal to rank of that power, use whichever is higher your actual Strength or the
substitute. This effective Strength is used whenever Strength is referenced in relation to grabbing in any way
(including escaping).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Make an attack check (close unarmed if not using an effect) against the target, resisted as
normal (with Parry or Dodge if using a ranged grab effect). If successful, make an opposed check with the target's
Strength against your Strength. If you win by 1, the target is restrained (immobile and vulnerable). If you win by 2 or
more your opponent becomes bound (defenseless, immobile, and impaired). You can attempt to improve an existing hold with
another grab action on a following turn, doing so does not use an attack check but still requires a Strength check. If
you win the target becomes bound, if you tie nothing happens, but if you lose the target escapes.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are hindered and vulnerable while grabbing and holding an opponent. You can maintain a
successful grab as a free action each turn, but cannot perform other actions requiring the use of your grabbing limb(s)
while doing so. Since maintaining a grab is a free action, you can take a standard action to inflict your Strength
damage to a grabbed target on subsequent turns after the grab is established.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can drag a restrained or bound target along with you when you move. The target gets a
Strength resistance check against your Strength. If you win, you move and the target moves along with you but your
normal ground speed is reduced by 1 rank. If the target resists, you are immobilized that turn (and lose the move action
you attempted) unless you release your hold on the target.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can end a grab (releasing your target) as a free action. If you are unable to take the free
action maintain the hold, the target is automatically released. A target can attempt to escape from a grab as a move
action (see <b>Escape</b>).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MOVE---MOVE-ACTION">MOVE - MOVE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can move up to your speed rank in any movement mode available to you. Normal ground speed
is speed rank 0 (up to 30 feet per action). If you choose to move twice on your turn (taking two move actions) then you
move your speed rank each time. You can make a DC 5 Sprinting (Str) check as a free action to run faster, if you succeed
your ground speed rank increases by 1 during this round only.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-READY---STANDARD-ACTION">READY - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you would normally act on your
initiative, but before your initiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so you can move as well.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can ready a single standard, move, or free action. To do so, specify the action you will
take and the circumstances under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next turn, you may take the readied
action as a reaction to those circumstances.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed your readied action, you don't get to
take the readied action, you just lose your previous turn. You can ready the same action again on your next turn, if you
wish, continuing to wait for the right circumstances.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SMASH---STANDARD-ACTION">SMASH - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You attempt to damage or break an object held or worn by an opponent. This may be done with any
damaging attack. Make an attack check against the defense (Parry or Dodge) of the character with the object, with a -1
attack penalty if you are attacking a held object. If your attack check succeeds, you inflict damage on the object
rather than the character. See <b>Damaging Objects</b> for details on breaking things.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STAND---MOVE-ACTION">STAND - MOVE ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You stand up from a prone position as a move action. This can be done as a free action by
passing a DC 10 Acrobatics check but if you fail then you wasted a move action flopping onto the ground.
Characters with the <b>Instant Up</b> advantage can stand as a free action without a skill check.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-TRIP---STANDARD-ACTION">TRIP - STANDARD ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You try to trip or throw your opponent to the ground. For a trip attempt make a close attack
check with a -1 circumstance penalty against your opponent's Parry. If the attack succeeds, make an opposed check of your damage against your
opponent's Acrobatics or Balance (Agl) skill check. If you win, the defender is now prone in the same square instead of
causing damage. If you lose, nothing happens.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Throwing your opponent first requires you to be grabbing your opponent following by a Strength
check to see how far they can be thrown. If you are not already holding your opponent then make a grab attempt but only
the attack check portion. If the check fails nothing happens. If you win, or are already holding your opponent, the grab
ends and they are prone in the desired square.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-MANEUVERS">MANEUVERS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">A <b>maneuver</b> is a different way of performing a particular action. For example, a
defensive attack is an attack action that improves your defenses at the cost of accuracy. maneuvers are optional, you
choose which, if any, apply to your action(s) when you declare them. The GM decides if a particular maneuver is
appropriate or prohibited by circumstances.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Certain advantages and effects may enhance or work in conjunction with certain maneuvers. See
their descriptions for details.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ACCURATE-ATTACK">ACCURATE ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you make an attack, you can take a -1 penalty on the effect modifier of the attack and get
a +1 bonus to your attack. You can't use this if the effect modifier would be reduced to 0 or below. The changes are declared before you make the
attack check and only apply for this one action.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ALL-OUT-ATTACK">ALL-OUT ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you make an attack you can take a -1 penalty on your active defenses (Dodge and Parry) and
get a +1 bonus to your attack. You can't use this if either defense bonuses would be reduced to 0 or below. The changes to attack and defense bonus
are declared before you make the attack check and last until the start of your next turn.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEFENSIVE-ATTACK">DEFENSIVE ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you make an attack you can take a -1 penalty on your attack bonus and get a +1 to your
active defenses (Dodge and Parry). You can't use this if your attack bonus would be reduced to 0 or below. The changes to attack and defense bonus
last until the start of your next turn. This maneuver can't be used for a Perception range attack (because it doesn't
have an attack check).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEMORALIZE">DEMORALIZE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can perform an <a href="4-skills.html#TOC-DEMORALIZING">Intimidation</a> skill check in
combat as a standard action to undermine an opponent's confidence (see skill page for details).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FEINT">FEINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception
check as a standard action opposed by the better of your target's Deception or Insight. If your Deception check
succeeds, the target is vulnerable against your next attack or until the end of your next round (see <b>Vulnerable</b>
in the <b>Conditions</b> section of <a href="1-the-basics.html">The Basics</a>).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FINISHING-ATTACK">FINISHING ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A finishing attack is a non-routine attack against a defenseless target at close range, with
the intent to kill. The DC is 0 and is always a critical hit (see <b>Critical Hits</b>). This generally means your attack hits
automatically. If the target's resistance check has three or more degrees of failure, the target dies immediately.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-POWER-ATTACK">POWER ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you make an attack you can take a -1 penalty on your attack bonus and get a +1 bonus to
the effect rank. You can't use this if your attack bonus would be reduced to 0 or below. The changes are declared before you make the attack check
and only apply for this one action. This maneuver can't be used for a Perception range attack (because it doesn't have
an attack check).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SLAM-ATTACK">SLAM ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When you charge, you can charge right into your target, using your momentum to strengthen your
attack, but potentially receiving some damage from the impact yourself. The damage rank for your attack equals your
movement speed rank, or your normal damage rank, whichever is higher. If you move your full speed before you charge,
increase your damage by either means by an additional +1 circumstance bonus. The Gamemaster may limit your base slam
attack damage (before applying circumstance modifiers) by the series power level.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Your hero flies into a foe, moving at speed rank
10. His unarmed damage (Strength) rank is only 2, so he uses his speed rank of 10 for the damage. Since he also moved his full
speed to build up momentum, he increases his damage by +1 for a total damage rank of 11. If a base damage rank of 10 is too
high for the series, the GM may impose a lower limit on his slam attack damage, reducing the damage to the maximum permissible.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You suffer some of the impact of slamming into a target; make a Toughness resistance check
against half the damage rank of your attack (rounded down).</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Your hero hits his target with a slam attack damage
of 11, divided by 2, equals 5.5, and rounded down is 5 which means your hero must make his own Toughness resistance check against
damage rank 5.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Bonuses to Toughness protect against slam attack damage normally. Immunity to slam damage you
inflict or is inflicted to you is not possible.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-TEAM-ATTACK">TEAM ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Multiple attackers can attempt to combine their attacks in order to overwhelm an opponent's
resistance. The attacks to be combined must have the same effect and resistance and be within 5 ranks of each other. So
attacks all doing Damage against Toughness can combine, but not with a Mental Blast, for example, which is a Damage
effect, but resisted by Will rather than Toughness.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The attackers must all delay to the same point in the initiative order (that of the slowest
attacker). Each attacker makes an attack check against the target's defense. Effects not requiring an attack check may
be used in a team attack; count the effect as having one degree of success, if it is not the main attack.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Take the largest effect rank of the attacks that hit and count the combined degrees of success
for the other attacks: one degree provides a +1 circumstance bonus to the rank of the main attack, three or more
provides a +2 circumstance bonus. Unlike a normal team check, degrees of failure do not reduce success; those attacks
simply miss and have no effect. See <b>Team Checks</b> in <a href="1-the-basics.html">The Basics</a> for more. Also see <a
href="#TOC-AID---STANDARD-ACTION">Aid</a> standard action above</div>
