<h1>Ranks &amp; Measures</h1>
<p>This game uses the term <b>rank</b> when talking about the value of a game trait. So you might say a hero has "rank 8
Strength" or simply "Strength 8" (which mean the same thing), or that an effect is rank 5, 9, 15, or what have you.
Every quantifiable trait in the game has a rank assigned to it.</p>
<p>The game also uses a system of <b>measures</b>, real world values like pounds, seconds, minutes, hours, feet, yards,
and miles, to name a few. There is a direct relationship between rank and measure, as shown on the <b>Measurements
Table</b>.</p>
<div class="right-panel green-panel">
<div>Things to Know About Measurements</div>
<div>
<p>When using the Measurements Table, there are a few important things to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Each rank represents a range of measures</b>. Time rank 4 is actually all measures between 0.8 and 1.6 minutes, and
time rank 16 is everything between 2.3 and 4.6 days! So if you're looking for a measurement that's not on the table, pick
the next highest one that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than 6.8 hours, but less than 14), and 6 miles is a
distance rank of 11 (more than 5.8 miles, but less than 12).</p>
<p><b>Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks</b>. In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed 14 hero
to cover 30 miles (distance 13) is rank -1, or 3 seconds. You can extend the negative side the Measurement Table just like you can the
positive side, with each lower rank halving the previous measurement. So rank -6 is 0.8 pounds, 0.095 seconds,
and 5.625 inches, for example.</p>
<p><b>Don't directly add ranks</b>. Putting rank 4 distance together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance! Rank
4 is a distance measurement of 480 feet. Rank 6 is 1,900 feet. Adding the measurements, you get about 2,400
feet. 2,400 feet is distance rank 7 but rank 10 distance is 4 miles! If you have different ranks, it is best
to either handle them separately or convert them to measurements, add the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank.</p>
<p><b>Measurements are approximate</b>. Especially at the higher end, where each rank represents a wide range of
measurements, the Measurements Table isn't intended to provide precise values; it's just a ballpark estimate so you have
an idea of how things work in the context of the game. Don't focus too heavily on precise answers, just use the table
for general guidelines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="TOC-MASS-WEIGHT-FORCE-AND-STRENGTH">Mass, Weight, Force, and Strength</h2>
<p>Weight is the amount of force an object applies based on its mass and the amount of gravity it is under. Strength is the ability
to exert force. Weight and strength ranks are equal to force ranks. Mass can be easily converted to weight (if under
Earth's gravity then the value is equal) however they are not the same thing since mass is the amount of substance that makes
up an object (the number of neutrons, protons, and electrons). In order to lift an object you must be able to exert more
force than the object's weight. Examples involving heavy objects will generally use the object's weight (rather than mass)
in order to remind everyone that objects may be under different amounts of gravity (particularly in space where nothing has weight).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-USING-THE-MEASUREMENTS-TABLE">Using The Measurements Table</h2>
<p>The relationship between rank and measure has a number of uses in this game.</p>
<p>First, the capabilities of many traits are translated from their rank into a measurement. So the amount of weight a
Strength rank of 3 can lift is determined by finding the equivalent weight measurement (force rank) on the table, or 400 lbf.
Similarly, the mass, distance, or time affected by various other traits, especially powers, is determined on the
Measurements Table.</p>
<p>Also, because the measurements on the table operate at the same scale (roughly doubling every rank), it is possible
to use it to quickly figure out relationships between things like mass, distance, speed, and time:</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Distance Rank = Time Rank + Speed Rank</span>
<p>To determine the distance a hero covers in a given amount of time, add the rank of the time to the rank of the hero's
speed, with normal human ground speed being rank 0. So a normal person can cover 3 miles in an hour (time 9 + speed 0 =
9, the rank for 2.9 miles). In fact, with normal human speeds, you can just directly compare the time and distance columns
of the table! As another example, a hero with Flight 12 can cover 12,000 miles in an hour! That's 12 (speed) + 9 (time) =
21, the rank for 12,000 miles. The same character can go an amazing 23 miles in just 6 seconds (the time of one action
round)!</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Time Rank = Distance Rank - Speed Rank</span>
<p>Reversing the previous formula, we can also figure out how long it takes someone at a particular speed to cover a
given distance, by subtracting the speed rank from the distance rank to get a time rank. So a normal human (speed 0)
walking 47 miles (distance 13) takes about 14 hours. A hero with Speed 14 covers the same distance in (13 - 14 = -1)
just 3 seconds!</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Mass Rank = Force Rank for weight under Earth's gravity</span>
<p>To make things easy the mass and force ranks match so that any object's weight rank when on Earth is equal to its
mass rank. Calculating the weight of objects under different amounts of gravity is more complex than it's worth.
Instead decide how many times stronger the gravity is compared to Earth, if it is twice as strong then add 1 to the weight
rank etc.</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Throwing Distance Rank = Strength Rank (force rank) - Weight Rank (force rank)</span>
<p>As another example, the distance rank a hero can throw something equals the hero's Strength rank minus the weight rank
of the object. So a hero with Strength 10 (able to exert 26 tons-force), picks up a 5 ton-force weight truck (force rank 8). Since 10 - 8 =
2, the hero can then toss the truck rank 2 distance (120 feet)!</p>
<h2 id="TOC-UNITS-AND-ACCURACY">Units And Accuracy</h2>
<p>The first table below uses United States customary units and the one below that uses the Metric system. <strong>
WARNING: the two tables are incompatible.</strong> All positive and negative ranks are based on rank 0 values and usually
have 2 significant digits. The cubic feet and inches values are based on 10 gallons rather than 1.3 cubic feet.
But as described in the side bar above they are not supposed to be accurate. They are designed
to be convenient and to counteract the law of diminishing return.</p>
