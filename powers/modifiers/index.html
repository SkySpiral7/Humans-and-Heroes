<div class="page-header-blue">MODIFIERS</div>
<p>Modifiers change how an effect works, making it more effective (an <b>extra</b>) or less
effective (a <b>flaw</b>). Modifiers have ranks, just like other traits. Extras increase a power's cost while flaws
decrease it. Unless its description specifies otherwise, a modifier is a permanent
change in how the effect works. That is, you do not have the option of
using the modifier or not, it always applies. Some modifiers increase an effect's cost per rank, others apply an
unchanging cost to the power's total; these are called <b>flat modifiers</b>. For different versions of an effect with
different modifiers--such as a regular Damage effect and one with the Area modifier--see the <b>Alternate
Effect</b> modifier.</p>
<p>The final cost of a power is determined by base effect costs, modified by extras and flaws,
multiplied by the power's rank, with flat modifiers applied to the total cost.</p>
<div class="generated-class-5">Power Cost = ((base effect costs + extras - flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-APPLYING-MODIFIERS">APPLYING MODIFIERS</h2>
<p>An extra increases an effect's cost per rank by a set amount (usually 1 point) while a flaw
decreases the effect's cost per rank by a set amount (usually 1 point as well). To determine the effect's final cost per
rank, take the base cost, add up all the extras, and subtract all of the flaws.</p>
<div class="generated-class-5">Modified Cost = base effect cost + extras - flaws</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FRACTIONAL-COSTS">FRACTIONAL COSTS</h3>
<p>If total flaws reduce an effect's cost per rank to less than 1 character point, each additional
-1 to cost per rank beyond that adds to the number of ranks of the effect you get by spending 1 character point on a
1-to-1 basis.</p>
<p>In essence, an effect's cost can be expressed as the ratio of character points per rank (PP:R).
So an effect costing 3 points per rank is 3:1. If that effect has a total of -2 in modifiers, it costs 1:1, or 1
character point per rank. Applying another -1 modifier adds to the second part of the ratio, making it 1:2, or 1
character point per two ranks, and so forth.</p>
<p>Continue the progression for further reductions. Gamemasters may wish to limit the final
modified cost ratio of any effect in the series (to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, or whatever figure is appropriate). As a general
rule, 1:5 (five ranks per character point) should be the lowest modified cost for an effect, but the GM sets the limit
(if any).</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A hero has Protection, which costs 1 point per
rank. Protection has two modifiers; the first is the Imperious extra (a +1 point per rank modifier), and the second is the
flaw Limited to Blunt Physical Attacks (a -3 points per rank modifier) for a total modifier of -2. Since Protection costs
1 point per rank, the -2 modifier increases the number of ranks per character point, so the final cost is 1 character point
per 3 ranks of Impervious Protection Limited to Blunt physical Attacks.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-PARTIAL-MODIFIERS">PARTIAL MODIFIERS</h3>
<p>You can apply a modifier to only some of an effect's ranks and not others to fine-tune the
effect. A modifier must apply to at least one rank, and may apply to as many ranks as the effect has. The change in cost
and effect applies only to the ranks with the modifier; the unmodified ranks have their normal cost and effect.</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Marksman's micro-rockets are a Damage 7 effect.
They also explode on impact, for a Burst Area Damage effect, but the Area Damage is only rank 4. So the first 4 ranks of the
Marksman's Damage effect have the Burst Area modifier, costing 1 point more (or 3 per rank). The remaining 3 ranks have
their usual cost (2 per rank). Marksman makes a normal ranged attack check against the main target for his micro-rocket
launcher; if he hits, the target has to resist Damage 7, and everyone within the area around the target resists Damage 4
(the Area Damage). Even if he misses, the main target has to resist the Area Damage 4, since the micro-rocket explodes close
by! In Marksman's business, it pays to cover your bases...</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FLAT-VALUE-MODIFIERS">FLAT-VALUE MODIFIERS</h3>
<p>Some modifiers, rather than increasing or decreasing an effect's cost per rank, have a flat
value in character points, noted as <b>flat</b> in the modifier's header. For example, the Subtle extra costs only 1 or
2 points, depending on how subtle the effect is. Likewise, the Activation flaw has a flat value of -1 or -2 points,
depending on how long the power takes to activate.</p>
<p>Flat-value modifiers are applied to the final cost of an effect, after its cost per rank and
total cost for its number of ranks is determined. So, for example, if an effect costs 2 points per rank, with +1 per
rank for extras and -2 per rank for flaws. It has a final adjusted cost of (2 + 1 - 2) or 1 point per rank. With 8
ranks, it costs 8 character points. If the same effect also has a flat-value extra costing 2 points and a flat-value
flaw worth -1 point, then you add 2 to the final cost and subtract 1, for a total of (8 points for the effect + 2 points
for the flat extra - 1 point for the flat flaw) or 9 character points. modified cost + flat extra value - flat flaw
value</p>
<p>A flat-value flaw cannot reduce an effect or power's final cost below 1 character point.</p>
