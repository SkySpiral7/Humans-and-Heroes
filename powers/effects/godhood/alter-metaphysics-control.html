<div style="padding:5px">Note that the numbering I gave to the meta levels in the table above is arbitrary and
meaningless. The power <b>Reality Warp</b> does not include everything of in meta level 1 since it can't alter things
like logic which would be catastrophic much like altering metaphysics is. The reason why logic manipulation is included
here instead of <b>Reality Warp</b> where it should be is so that it can't be purchased.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This "power" gives you the ability to alter any and everything (at meta level 2 or below)
making all other traits obsolete. For example you could decide to roll five 20 sided dies and use the sum and force
someone else to only use a 4 sided die at any time, you can change 1+1=3, you could make all humans have four arms
naturally, you can control any character, move universes, change logic so that whoever is wearing the color green is
automatically correct in an argument then change it back etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The reason why this power has its cost marked as &infin; is to represent the fact that no
amount of character points can cause a player to become a Gamemaster. In order to become a Gamemaster it must be agreed
on by the players. The reason why this is listed as a power is for completeness reasons.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This power's point costs does not affect the Power Level of the owner, unless you want to since
you now have authority over Power Levels. A limited version of this power is possible such as Limited to Logic
Manipulation doing so would allow great power without creating another Gamemaster.</div>
