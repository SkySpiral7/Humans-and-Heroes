<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-ADVANTAGE-DESCRIPTIONS">ADVANTAGE DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Each advantage is listed by name and type. There is also a trait listed that this advantage is
an upgrade of, followed by cost then a description of the advantage's benefits.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-BEYOND-MORTAL">BEYOND MORTAL (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <b>Selective</b> <a
href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 50 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can choose to be immune to any power or effect that is of a lower Transcendence than you
(nature is considered Transcendence -1). This is based on your Transcendence at full HP. The default for this Advantage
is immune so that if you are unaware you will be immune. This makes some forms of <b>Immunity</b> obsolete since you are
no longer affected by the environment such as suffocation, fire, and poison. Although <b>Immunity</b> will still protect
you from something of equal Transcendence. Note that being immune to gravity means you will not take damage nor be
pulled in by it, this allows you to remain stationary although <b>Flight</b> is still required to move away.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-LET-THERE-BE">LET THERE BE (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <b>Precise</b> <a href="../create-control.html">Create</a>
&#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 40 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When you use Create you can create anything regardless of complexity and composition. You can
even create life, stars, universes, dimensions, and timelines. You are still required to understand how it works before
you can create it (see <b>Omniscient</b> below). Powers gained from <b>A God I Am</b> and <b>Supreme</b> gain the
benefits of this Advantage. When creating a universe can choose it to wrap around or for it to have a wall or some kind
of boundary but any other rules and law of physics require the <b>Reality Warp</b> power. For reference our universe has
about volume rank 92 which would cost 37 points in <b>Supreme Create</b>. You can't use this to create anyone with super
powers and they will all be either Transcendence -1 or 0. However these creations are still temporary to get around this
see <b>Stay Like That</b> below</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-LUCK-OF-THE-GODS">LUCK OF THE GODS (FORTUNE)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <a href="../luck-control-control.html">Luck Control</a>
&#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 5 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your luck is so great that the universe seems to be conspiring with you to control fate. You
must have the last option of <b>Luck Control</b> before taking this, the odds are instead to 1 in 10 billion for a
single victory point, for 2 victory points you can make the impossible happen, and for 3 victory points you can make the
impossible happen in convenient ways. The GM can increase the victory points required if you are using it to ruin the
story, if the final cost is more than 5 then you can't do it at all.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The mayor of the city confronts Mr. Impossible
to repair the city of damages incurred by the fight that was just concluded. To answer this Mr. Impossible spends 1 victory
point to buy a lottery ticket which he gives to the mayor assuring that it will be the winner which the mayor finds out later
to be true.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mr. Impossible needs to get ahold of the space
metal known as Adamantium. The GM tells the player that for 2 victory points a repository of the metal will be discovered
somewhere on Earth today and with some research you can find out where. Mr. Impossible decides that this isn't good enough
and instead spends 3 victory points to have a harmless meteor crash down right now landing within 5 feet of where he is currently
standing. He could have it land within the palm of his hand if he were able to catch it without taking damage.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mr. Impossible knows of a giant solar flare coming
straight towards Earth threatening to kill millions of people. He decides that it would be "impossible" but convenient for
an inter-dimensional ripple to suddenly pass through and disrupt the flare. The GM charges 2 more victory points, for a total
of 5, because the player is getting lazy and over relying on his God-like luck.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-OMNIPRESENT">OMNIPRESENT (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <a href="../insubstantial-general.html">Insubstantial</a>
&#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 5 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You don't exist in the universe so much as the universe IS you. <b>Teleport</b> and <b>time
travel</b> among others become obsolete since you can interact with any part of yourself at any time. There are some
areas that you might not exist in depending on your rank:</div>
<ul>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>1 rank</b>: You exist everywhere in this universe and at every time up to the present.</li>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>2 ranks</b>: You now also exist in every universe, dimension, timelines etc.</li>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>3 ranks</b>: You now also exist in every possible future.</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that this advantage doesn't give you the ability to observe everything within yourself nor
know everything within yourself. For those see Perfect Focus and Omniscient. You may interact with any number of places
at the same time but this is useless unless you can handle simultaneous information.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-OMNISCIENT">OMNISCIENT (SKILL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Skill</b>: Knowledge &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 5 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You automatically pass any Knowledge or Memory based check depending on rank in
Omniscient:</div>
<ul>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>1 rank</b>: You have perfect memory that can only be changed by characters of equal or higher
Transcendence. You also know everything about everything around you at a maximum of distance rank 24 radius (64k miles) but
only knowledge of the present. This includes knowing everything in everyone's mind including memories but does not actually
see into the past for things that no one remembers or knows about. You also know everything about yourself since you are
within the radius at all times (assuming you are not larger than the radius).</li>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>2 ranks</b>: Your knowledge radius has expanded to distance rank 48 (0.2 light-years which
is about 320 times the radius of Pluto's average distance from the sun: ie a lot bigger than the solar system). Additionally
your knowledge can now also see into the past up to time rank 33 (1600 years).</li>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>3 ranks</b>: Your knowledge radius has expanded to the entire universe and goes back to the
dawn of time.</li>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>4 ranks</b>: Your knowledge expands to all universes, dimensions, timelines etc not just the
one you are currently in.</li>
<li style="padding:5px 0px"><b>5 ranks</b>: Your knowledge expands to all possible futures.</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding:5px">This power never allows you to read the minds of characters with equal to or more Transcendence
than yourself although you can observe whatever they do (and might possibly do). Note that alternate timelines are
simply alternate presents (with alternate pasts) as opposed to possible futures which haven't occurred yet to confirm
which one is mainstream (ie the timeline you are on). A character with 5 ranks can easily determine which future will
occur based on what everyone is going to do but only if there are no other equal to or higher Transcendence characters
to change the situation. You can see all the possible futures based on your own actions too.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-PERFECT-FOCUS">PERFECT FOCUS (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <a href="../sample-powers/Features/mental-fission.html">Mental Fission</a>
&#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 5 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You have perfect multitasking: you can give an infinite number of things 100% of your
attention. This does not affect concentration duration.
You have an infinite number of subminds. Each submind has its own surface thoughts, have the same
intelligence as the overall mind, and all connect to the overall mind. Since the overall mind has information from each
of them you can make decisions based on each. This is not multiple personalities although each submind has their own
surfaces thoughts which causes problems for any mind reader. If a mind reader only gets one degree of success then they
can't hear anything over the cacophony of an infinite amount of surface thoughts at the same time. If a mind reader gets
more than 1 degree of success then they can read any of the surface thoughts of their choice or any combination thereof.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-STAY-LIKE-THAT">STAY LIKE THAT (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <a href="../index.html">Any</a> &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 15 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can make a temporary effect last indefinitely. When taking this advantage choose a power
that has Continuous duration and does not have Personal range, that power's duration becomes Instant and its effects do
not wear off. You may choose <b>Reality Warp</b> for this if possible. You can't apply this to <b>Phantom Ranks</b> or
<b>Variable</b> (including <b>A God I Am</b>). You can't apply this to any form of movement or any feature that wouldn't
make sense. <b>Nullify</b> can still counter these powers but can no longer end them since they are not considered
ongoing. <b>Illusions</b> created can still be overcome with a Will defense check but will linger for any new characters
to the scene. For <b>Growth</b> and <b>Shrinking</b>: you can't increase a target's size beyond your Growth rank -2 and
you can't decrease its size beyond (-2 - Shrinking rank). You can also apply this to <b>Mind Switch</b>, <b>Mental
Transform</b>, and <b>Weaken</b> in such cases the effects do not wear off. In the case of <b>Enhanced Trait</b> you can
bestow powers to anyone or revoke them with a permanent <b>Weaken</b>. (Note: <b>Weaken</b> can't currently target
character points or powers).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-SUPREME">SUPREME (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: <a href="../index.html">Any</a> &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are very powerful at using a particular power. When taking this advantage choose a power,
you gain 5 points to use for that power but it has 1 less Transcendence.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-VARIABLE-MODIFIER">VARIABLE MODIFIER (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: None &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 35 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can use any combination of modifiers on any power you have at any time. You may have to
stop using an effect before you can change its modifier depending on the change. Any modifiers you add or remove are
free (the 35 points you've already paid covers the costs), this includes changing duration and range. The one exception
is that you can't get <b>Innate</b> with this instead use <b>Phantom Ranks</b> you also can't change the modifiers of
<b>Innate</b> effects unless you buy this again as <b>Innate</b>. The cost is actually much cheaper than it should be
and that's one reason why it can only be used by God-like characters. Powers gained from <b>A God I Am</b> gain the
benefits of this Advantage.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-23" id="TOC-YOUR-PETTY-RULES-DON'T-APPLY-TO-ME">YOUR PETTY RULES DON'T APPLY TO ME (GENERAL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Power</b>: None &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 50 points</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are no longer bound by limitations imposed by power level: powers, attacks, skills and
defenses no longer have a maximum rank and there is no longer a minimum wait time between revivals for reviving yourself
or others of lower Transcendence.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you die anyone may attempt to revive you ignoring the amount of time that has passed since
your last revival. Likewise if you have (temporarily or permanently) <b>Immortality</b> of a rank higher than the normal
maximum you may benefit from it. You may also attempt to revive anyone of lower Transcendence ignoring the time since
their last revival. The power check for revival is still performed normally in any case.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Powers have no maximum rank even if the maximum was not based on power level. The maximum rank
of advantages are unaffected. All other rules still apply. All of your powers gain the benefits of this Advantage even
ones gained from <b>A God I Am</b> or from someone else's power that has an <b>Affects others</b> modifier.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a character gains a power that is above the normal maximum rank but does not have this
advantage they instead can only use the power as though it had maximum rank.</div>
