<div style="padding:5px">You can better resist certain descriptors. When taken choose a descriptor or a base power to
resist. The descriptor chosen can include natural causes such as suffocation. You can't apply the <b>Variable
Descriptor</b> modifier to this power. If you have more than one <b>Resistance</b> of the same type then only the
highest applies.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When you are affected by that power or descriptor after you roll an activate defense but before
you roll a passive defense, roll an opposed power check as though this power was countering that effect, if you succeed
you are immune to the effect (but it isn't countered). You are immune in case of a tie. For example, if you have Fire
<b>Resistance</b> 5 and you roll a 2 against a rank 9 Fire <b>Damage</b> who rolls -2 then 5+2 vs 9-2 is 7 vs 7 which means
you are immune. If you are have more than one <b>Resistance</b> that might make you immune, roll each of them
separately. If at least one succeeds you are immune. If you fail all of them roll the passive defense normally.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This power has a maximum rank equal to the power level. Note that this is more worth while than
<b>Enhanced Trait</b>: Toughness limited to fire (1 point per 2 ranks) because: you can have both this and high
toughness, this will resist effects that are not resisted by toughness, and you get to roll twice (bell curves are
safer). This power is cheaper than Triggered action <b>Nullify</b> at the cost of only making you immune instead of
ending the effect.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Area</b>: If you make <b>Resistance</b> an area effect then everyone (or everything) in the
area will be immune. The power check for <b>Resistance</b> is only rolled once and the result applies to each subject.
<b>See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a> for cost and details.</b></div>
