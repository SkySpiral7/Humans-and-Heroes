<p>Nullify can counter particular effects of a particular descriptor, such as fire effects,
magical effects, mental effects, technology effects, and so forth (see <b>Countering Effects</b>). The Gamemaster has
the final say if something is too broad such as mutant if all powers are mutant. You can counter one effect of your
chosen descriptor per use of Nullify. You can't apply <b>Variable Descriptor</b> to this power since it is already
broad. You can't nullify innate effects (see the <b>Innate</b> modifier description).</p>
<p>Make a ranged attack check to hit the target. Then make an opposed check of your Nullify rank
and the targeted effect's rank or the target's Will defense, whichever is higher. If you are targeting the subject of an
effect rather than the effect's user, make an opposed check of Nullify rank vs. effect rank. If you win, the targeted
effect turns off, although the user can reactivate it normally. If you lose the opposed check, you do not Nullify the
effect. With two or more degrees of failure, trying again against the same subject in the same scene requires extra
effort.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Aura</b>: If Nullify has an Area and an Aura (a Big Aura) then it will act as a barrier
against the chosen descriptors automatically countering them when entering range (a power check is still required).
See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AURA">Aura</a> for cost and details.</p>
<p><b>Affects Insubstantial</b>: Nullify does not require this modifier to affect insubstantial
targets, or the <a href="insubstantial-general.html">Insubstantial</a> effect itself. You can attempt to nullify the
effects of insubstantial targets normally.</p>
<p><b>Alternate Resistance</b>: Nullify may require a Fortitude rather than a Will check to
represent an effect resisted by health and stamina rather than strength of will. <b>+0 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Area</b>: An Area Nullify effect works on all targets in the area. Make a single power check
and compare the result against the opposed checks of the targets. Targets lacking effects you can nullify are,
naturally, unaffected. Keep in mind that if you do not have the <b>Simultaneous</b> extra then each target must be using
the same power to be affected. For example if there are people using magic based <b>Flight</b> and people with magic
based <b>protection</b> both within range and you use <b>Nullify</b>: Magic to counter the <b>Flight</b> then the <b>protected</b> ones will not be
affected unless you have <b>Simultaneous</b>. <b>See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a> for cost and
details.</b></p>
<p><b>Simultaneous</b>: Simultaneous Nullify can counter all effects of a particular descriptor
(such as fire or magic) at once. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Effortless</b>: Trying again after two or more degrees of failure does not require extra
effort for you. You can retry a Nullify attempt an unlimited number of times. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Precise</b>: If you can Nullify multiple effects, this modifier allows you to choose which
are nullified and which are not. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Randomize</b>: Rather than being countered, the effect(s) targeted by your Nullify acquire
the Uncontrolled flaw and go out of control (as dictated by the GM). <b>+0 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Selective</b>: If you have an Area Nullify effect, this extra allows you to choose who in
the area is affected, nullifying some targets and not others. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Side Effect</b>: If you fail to nullify an effect, you might suffer some kind of "backlash"
or similar side effect. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
