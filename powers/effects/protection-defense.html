<div style="padding:5px">Protection shields you against damage, giving you +1 to your Toughness defense per rank. So
Protection 4 gives you +4 Toughness. Although this is simply <a href="enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait:
Toughness</a> there is a key difference in that this is layered. First of all since this isn't <a
href="enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait</a> you may apply Area Affects Others to this thus protecting everyone
within range. But more notably that being layered means that it is redundent with other forms of enhanced toughness. For
example a hero with Thoughness 3 will not benefit from wearing armor of Protection 1 likewise while wearing an armor
with Protection 3 having Toughness 1 is irrelevant unless the attack ignores or otherwise pierces armor (neither
currently possible). In the same way wearing 2 layers of Protection 2 armor is redundant but in contrast having a
necklace of <a href="enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Trait: Toughness</a> Affects Others Only will increase
toughnes of the wearer higher than what it already is, as long as it is still within the power level limitations. As an
exception the <b>Defensive Roll</b> advantage stacks with both toughness and protection.</div>

<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reflect</b>: You can reflect attacks back at the attacker as a free action. First, you must
successfully resist the attack using your protection's toughness, then make a normal attack check using your own attack
modifier but the attack effect's normal rank to hit with the reflected attack. It has its normal effect if it hits.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Redirect</b>: You must first have the Reflect extra to take this one. You can redirect the
reflected attack at any target within the attack's normal range. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sustained</b> (Decreased Duration 2): Your Protection is a sustained effect, rather than
permanent. The effect can be turned on and off and can be improved using extra effort, including using it to perform
stunts (see <b>Extra Effort</b>). Sustained Protection might be a power like a personal force field, or the ability to
consciously harden your skin and turn it into armor. <b>+0</b></div>
