<h1>IMMUNITY (DEFENSE)</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: Varies</span>
<p>You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding on any resistance check against
them (most do not have would-be resistance checks). When taking this power choose one of the following options each must be taken as
different powers.</p>
<p>To clarify: immunity can't be countered as long as it has permanent duration, this means that
you can't counter an immunity when it occurs (it is not a reaction to the event).</p>
<p>If you'd like to have immunity from something not listed here then it needs to be minor and is probably worth 1 point but
consult your GM first. You can never be immune to
anything that causes damage nor anything extremely broad such as "all viruses".</p>
<p>There are some circumstances where a character or object will be immune to an effect such as a
sword that can't harm the pure of heart or a mental power that only works on characters who have delta brain waves. This
is a complication or limitation flaw but not immunity.</p>
<p>Note that <b>immunity</b> to motion sickness (this includes sea sickness and car sickness) is redundant since by default
people do not get motion sick. If you would like motion sickness see <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complications</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-AGE">AGE</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>Your character doesn't suffer from the downsides of natural aging (namely death). You can still die from other causes.
How old your character appears to be
is up to you. Note however that your character is normal adult human size by default for anything smaller see <a href="shrinking-general.html">shrinking</a>.
Additionally you may want to consider <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complications</a> that are a result of not aging.</p>
<p>The GM may allow this immunity to provide protection from all forms of ageing (this isn't <a href="immortality-defense.html">immortality</a>),
otherwise use <a href="resistance-defense.html">Resistance to Ageing Effects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NATURAL-HEAT">NATURAL HEAT</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You are immune to natural heat such that you do not need to make any Fortitude checks because of heat (uncomfortable,
intense, or extreme) as described in <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-HEAT-AND-COLD">Environment: heat and cold</a>.
This does not make you immune to heat <a href="damage-attack.html">damage</a> even from natural sources such as fire, lava, smoke etc.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NATURAL-COLD">NATURAL COLD</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You are immune to natural cold such that you do not need to make any Fortitude checks because of heat (uncomfortable,
intense, or extreme) as described in <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-HEAT-AND-COLD">Environment: heat and cold</a>.
This does not make you immune to cold <a href="damage-attack.html">damage</a> even from natural sources such as liquid nitrogen
or supercooled water.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STARVATION-AND-THIRST">STARVATION AND THIRST</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You do not need to eat or drink to survive and thus are not subject to <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-STARVATION-AND-THIRST">starvation rules</a>.
More generally you can survive without any kind of required maintenance except sleep unless you are <a href="#TOC-SLEEP">immune to that</a>
as well.</p>
<p>If you would like your character to require something like sunlight or rocks instead of food or drink then either
use character description or a <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complication</a> depending on
the abundance of the required thing. If the thing required is hard to fail to obtain, such as sunlight, then take this <b>immunity</b>
and have a <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complication</a> which states that you will either
die or lose powers (at a minimum this one) without the required thing. For anything else, such as electricity, do not take
this <b>immunity</b> and with your Gamemaster's approval have this thing count as both food and water.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SLEEP">SLEEP</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You do not require sleep and are unaffected by <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-SLEEP-DEPRIVATION">sleep deprivation</a>
rules. You may still fall asleep by choice and can be forced asleep by fatigue (see <a href="../../the-basics/conditions.html#TOC-PROGRESSIVE-CONDITIONS">progressive
conditions</a>). You can still gain the <a href="../../the-basics/conditions.html">conditions</a> Fatigued, Exhausted, and
Asleep and do not get a bonus to resist fatigue effects such as <a href="affliction-attack.html">affliction</a> (with appropriate
descriptors) or <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-FORCED-LABOR">forced labor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-YOUR-OWN-POWERS">YOUR OWN POWERS</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You are immune to your own powers except <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-REMOVABLE">removable powers</a>, equipment,
and unarmed attacks. <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a>
attacks by default don't hurt the user and this <b>immunity</b> does not protect you from the <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-SIDE-EFFECT">side
effect flaw</a>. The main purpose of this <b>immunity</b> is so that you can obtain clothing immune to your powers although
the Gamemaster may permit such clothing to be free of charge. Another benefit of this <b>immunity</b> is that if you are
being <a href="../../the-basics/conditions.html">compelled or controlled</a> you won't be able to hurt yourself (except
with <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-REMOVABLE">removable powers</a>, equipment, or unarmed attacks).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-VERY-NARROW-DESCRIPTOR">VERY NARROW DESCRIPTOR</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>By default this <b>immunity</b> is not allowed however the Gamemaster may permit it for certain cases. You are immune to
a very narrow descriptor such as a close sibling's powers, or 3rd generation star lab nanobots. Generally this should be
handled by <a href="resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> so that it could be overpowered or by <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-SELECTIVE">selective</a>
so that the user chooses who is affected.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NATURAL-PRESSURE">NATURAL PRESSURE</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You do not get <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-RAPID-DECOMPRESSION">decompression sickness</a> and can tolerate
a wider range of pressure without issue. You can tolerate no pressure (a vacuum) and a maximum high pressure equal to the
bottom of Earth's ocean. Pressure that is any higher acts as <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> which you have no bonus
towards (whether the pressure is naturally occurring or not). Even at these extremely high pressures you do get <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-RAPID-DECOMPRESSION">decompression sickness</a>.
There is no pressure below your threshold since a vacuum is the minimum possible pressure (having no pressure at all).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SUFFOCATION">SUFFOCATION</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 or 2 points</span>
<p>For 1 point you can breathe normally in 1 environment that would normally cause <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">suffocation</a>
such as underwater, on mars, being able to breathe dirt, etc. All other types of <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">suffocation</a>
affect you normally.</p>
<p>For 2 points you do not need to breathe at all. And thus are not subject to <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">suffocation</a>
in any environment.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-VACUUM">VACUUM</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 3 points</span>
<p>In order to survive a <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-VACUUM">Vacuum</a> this <b>Immunity</b> includes <a href="#TOC-SUFFOCATION">Immunity
to all Suffocation</a> (2 points) and <a href="#TOC-NATURAL-PRESSURE">Immunity to natural pressure</a> (1 point).
It does not include protection from <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-RADIATION">radiation</a> for that take <a href="resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a>
to radiation.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SENSORY-EFFECTS">SENSORY EFFECTS</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 5 points</span>
<p>You are immune to sensory based effects notably <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> (eg a flash-bang). Unlike normal
people when a sense is maxed out it does not cause pain and is not temporarily disabled. All of your senses still work normally
and you can still feel pain but there's a maximum that you can sense (anything above which is sensed as the maximum instead).
This makes you immune to physical torture but does not protect against mental torture.</p>
<p>A robot is an example use of this <b>immunity</b>: the sensors may max out but cause no further issue. Note that this makes
you immune to all sensory based effects including <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-SENSE-DEPENDENT">Sense-Dependent
powers</a>, <a href="../../skills.html">skills</a>, and circumstances (which may not have a defined trait at all).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-LIFE-SUPPORT">LIFE SUPPORT</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 6 points</span>
<p>This <b>immunity</b> includes everything that can be given for a human to survive: <a href="#TOC-NATURAL-HEAT">Immunity
to natural heat</a> (1 point), <a href="#TOC-NATURAL-COLD">Immunity to natural cold</a> (1 point), <a href="#TOC-NATURAL-PRESSURE">Immunity
to natural pressure</a> (1 point), <a href="#TOC-SUFFOCATION">Immunity to all suffocation</a> (2 points), and <a href="#TOC-NATURAL-HEAT">Immunity
to starvation and thirst</a> (1 point).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FATIGUE">FATIGUE</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 30 points</span>
<p>You must have a Stamina of 0 before buying this. This <b>immunity</b> makes you immune to all forms of fatigue. This
includes being <a href="#TOC-SLEEP">immune to sleep</a>. You are immune to Fatigue and Exhausted and never run out of Stamina.</p>
<p>You are immune to the effects of Fatigue and Exhausted (ie they
do nothing) but can still obtain them for the sake of tracking things like <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-HEAT-AND-COLD">heat
exhaustion</a>. Fatigue and Exhausted can be healed as normal including by resting. You can still fall asleep by choice but
can't be forced to obtain the asleep condition. If you are Exhausted and are affected by Fatigue you remain Exhausted instead
of becoming Asleep (the condition does not progress and nothing happens).</p>
<p>You can't have the <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-TIRING">tiring flaw</a> and can only use <a href="../../the-basics/index.html">extra
effort</a> by spending a victory point (rather than becoming Fatigued).</p>
<p>Your Stamina becomes &infin; except for calculating Fortitude and Toughness for which your Stamina is considered 0. You
are immune to <a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken: Stamina</a> (note that this <b>Immunity</b> itself is still affected by
<a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a>). You are immune to Stamina penalties (from conditions or circumstances). You
automatically pass all ability and skill checks that use Stamina. You do not make Fortitude checks because of long lasting
endurance and are therefore immune to half of the <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-FORCED-LABOR">forced labor</a>
rules (you are still affected by unusually difficult labor).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEGREES-OF-IMMUNITY">DEGREES OF IMMUNITY</h3>
<p>Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For example, "immunity to cold" can range from
the environmental effects of cold (described under <b>The Environment</b>) to cold damage, to complete immunity to all
effects with the "cold" descriptor. The first requires only 1 rank, and provides no resistance to other sorts of cold
effects. The second and third require <a href="resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> which might provides immunity to cold <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> and all other effects with the "cold" descriptor whatever they may be but can only
handle a certain threshold. No one can become immune to all <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a>: no matter how strong
any defense can be overwhelmed.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Affects Others</b>: This extra allows you to grant the benefits of your <b>Immunity</b> to others
by touch. <a href="#TOC-LIFE-SUPPORT">Immunity: life support</a> could, for example, maintain a life support "bubble" around you.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Ranged</b>: Affects Others <b>Immunity</b> may have this extra, allowing it to grant its benefits
at range. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h2>
<p><b>Sustained</b>: Sustained duration <b>Immunity</b> may be suitable for certain types of powers,
particularly force fields or similar protective abilities requiring a modicum of concentration. It is a net +0 modifier
from <b>Immunity</b>'s base permanent duration.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Limited to Half Effect</b>: You suffer half the normal effect rather than being entirely
immune to it. This can't be applied to <a href="#TOC-FATIGUE">immunity to fatigue</a>.
For environmental effects, you only make checks half as often. For other effects, halve the effect's rank
(round down) before determining its resistance check DC, including for things like Impervious. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
