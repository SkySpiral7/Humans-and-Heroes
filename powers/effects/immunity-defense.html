<h1>IMMUNITY (DEFENSE)</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: Varies</span>
<p>You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding on any resistance check against
them (most do not have would-be resistance checks). When taking this power choose one of the following options each must be taken as
different powers.</p>
<p>To clarify: immunity can't be countered as long as it has permanent duration, this means that
you can't counter an immunity when it occurs (it is not a reaction to the event).</p>
<p>If you'd like to have immunity from something not listed here then it needs to be minor and is probably worth 1 point but
consult your GM first. You can never be immune to
anything that causes damage nor anything extremely broad such as "all viruses".</p>
<p>There are some circumstances where a character or object will be immune to an effect such as a
sword that can't harm the pure of heart or a mental power that only works on characters who have delta brain waves. This
is a complication or limitation flaw but not immunity.</p>
<p>Note that <b>immunity</b> to motion sickness (this includes sea sickness and car sickness) is redundant since by default
people do not get motion sick. If you would like motion sickness see <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complications</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-AGE">AGE</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>Your character doesn't suffer from the downsides of natural aging (namely death). You can still die from other causes.
How old your character appears to be
is up to you. Note however that your character is normal adult human size by default for anything smaller see <a href="shrinking-general.html">shrinking</a>.
Additionally you may want to consider <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complications</a> that are a result of not aging.</p>
<p>The GM may allow this immunity to provide protection from all forms of ageing (this isn't <a href="immortality-defense.html">immortality</a>),
otherwise use <a href="resistance-defense.html">Resistance to Ageing Effects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NATURAL-HEAT">NATURAL HEAT</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You are immune to natural heat such that you do not need to make any Fortitude checks because of heat (uncomfortable,
intense, or extreme) as described in <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-HEAT-AND-COLD">Environment: heat and cold</a>.
This does not make you immune to heat <a href="damage-attack.html">damage</a> even from natural sources such as fire, lava, smoke etc.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NATURAL-COLD">NATURAL COLD</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You are immune to natural cold such that you do not need to make any Fortitude checks because of heat (uncomfortable,
intense, or extreme) as described in <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-HEAT-AND-COLD">Environment: heat and cold</a>.
This does not make you immune to cold <a href="damage-attack.html">damage</a> even from natural sources such as liquid nitrogen
or supercooled water.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STARVATION-AND-THIRST">STARVATION AND THIRST</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You do not need to eat or drink to survive and thus are not subject to <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-STARVATION-AND-THIRST">starvation rules</a>.
More generally you can survive without any kind of required maintenance except sleep unless you are <a href="#TOC-SLEEP">immune to that</a>
as well.</p>
<p>If you would like your character to require something like sunlight or rocks instead of food or drink then either
use character description or a <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complication</a> depending on
the abundance of the required thing. If the thing required is hard to fail to obtain, such as sunlight, then take this <b>immunity</b>
and have a <a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-COMPLICATIONS">complication</a> which states that you will either
die or lose powers (at a minimum this one) without the required thing. For anything else, such as electricity, do not take
this <b>immunity</b> and with your Gamemaster's approval have this thing count as both food and water.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SLEEP">SLEEP</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>need for sleep</p>
<p>If you do not require sleep you may still fall asleep if you choose and this does not grant any
protection against any afflictions.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-RARE-POWER-DESCRIPTOR">RARE POWER DESCRIPTOR</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>a rare power descriptor (such as your own powers, a close sibling's powers, etc. at the GM's discretion on whether it should instead be Resistance)</p>
<p>The reason why rare power descriptors are the only descriptors allowed is so that costumes may
be immune to your power and also some powers recognize their owner such as nano-bots that won't attack their master or
magic that can't backfire. If you want to choose other people the nano-bots won't damage use the Selective
modifier.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NATURAL-PRESSURE">NATURAL PRESSURE</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>You do not get <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-RAPID-DECOMPRESSION">decompression sickness</a> and can tolerate
a wider range of pressure without issue. You can tolerate no pressure (a vacuum) and a maximum high pressure equal to the
bottom of Earth's ocean. Pressure that is any higher acts as <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> which you have no bonus
towards (whether the pressure is naturally occurring or not). Even at these extremely high pressures you do get <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-RAPID-DECOMPRESSION">decompression sickness</a>.
There is no pressure below your threshold since a vacuum is the minimum possible pressure (having no pressure at all).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-closed system">closed system</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 point</span>
<p>A closed system means that poison and disease can't enter by any means including skin contact
(or battlesuit contact). No food, water, or air can enter a closed system in fact nothing can enter at all. To prevent
suffocation for a battlesuit you may wish to buy SCUBA Gear equipment for non-battlesuits this may be limited to a
single tank since switching mouth pieces would leave you temporarily susceptible. While your system is closed you may
also shut off any of your senses. To switch between opened and closed is a free action. Note that anything that pierces
into the system, including some kinds of damage, will temporarily breach (open) the system at the GM's discretion.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SUFFOCATION">SUFFOCATION</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 1 or 2 points</span>
<p>one type of suffocation (breathe normally underwater or in an alien atmosphere, for example)
or 2 points for all (no need to breathe at all). <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">see environment</a></p>
<h3 id="TOC-VACUUM">VACUUM</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 3 points</span>
<p>In order to survive a <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-VACUUM">Vacuum</a> this <b>Immunity</b> includes <a href="#TOC-SUFFOCATION">Immunity
to all Suffocation</a> (2 points) and <a href="#TOC-NATURAL-PRESSURE">Immunity to natural pressure</a> (1 point).
It does not include protection from <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-RADIATION">radiation</a> for that take <a href="resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a>
to radiation.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-sensory afflictions">sensory afflictions</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 5 points</span>
<p>sensory <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> effects</p>
<p>Immunity to sensory Affliction effects would be like constructs: a flash bang will not
temporarily blind them.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-fatigue effects">fatigue effects</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 5 points</span>
<p>eh?</p>
<p>Immunity to fatigue effects means that to use extra effort you must spend the victory point now
or are unable to do so.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-emotion effects">emotion effects</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 5 points</span>
<p>but only if you lack all emotion</p>
<h3 id="TOC-life support">life support</h3>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Cost</b>: 7 points</span>
<p>includes closed system (1), natural heat (1), natural cold (1), vacuum (1), all suffocation (2), and starvation and thirst (1)</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEGREES-OF-IMMUNITY">DEGREES OF IMMUNITY</h3>
<p>Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For example, "immunity to cold" can range from
the environmental effects of cold (described under <b>The Environment</b>) to cold damage, to complete immunity to all
effects with the "cold" descriptor. The first requires only 1 rank, and provides no resistance to other sorts of cold
effects. The second and third require <b>Resistance</b> which might provides immunity to cold <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> and all other effects with the "cold" descriptor whatever they may be but can only
handle a certain threshold.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Affects Others</b>: This extra allows you to grant the benefits of your Immunity to others
by touch. It's most commonly used with life support, such as the power to maintain a life support "bubble" around you.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Ranged</b>: Affects Others Immunity may have this extra, allowing it to grant its benefits
at range. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Reflect</b>: You can reflect attacks to which you are immune back at the attacker as a free
action. Make a normal attack check using your own attack modifier to hit with the reflected attack. It has its normal
effect if it hits. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Redirect</b>: You can redirect attacks to which are you are immune at any other target
within the attack's normal range, as Reflect, above. You must have the Reflect extra to take this one. <b>+1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h2>
<p><b>Sustained</b>: Sustained duration Immunity may be suitable for certain types of powers,
particularly force fields or similar protective abilities requiring a modicum of concentration. It is a net +0 modifier
from Immunity's base permanent duration.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Limited to Half Effect</b>: You suffer half the normal effect rather than being entirely
immune to it. For environmental effects, you only make checks half as often. For other effects, halve the effect's rank
(round down) before determining its resistance check DC, including for things like Impervious. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
