<div>EVOLUTIONARY DEFENSE</div>

<div style="padding:5px"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../variable-general.html">Variable</a> Faster
Action 3 (Free), see description for required limitation <b>&#8226; 10 points per rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px">This <a href="../variable-general.html">Variable</a> can only put ranks
into one of the following: <a href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a>, <a
href="../enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Toughness</a>, and <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a>. <a
href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> or <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> can only resist against a specific descriptor that
has targeted you before (even if completely resisted). Each of them have a maximum rank up to the rank highest rank that
has targeted you before. <a href="../enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Toughness</a> does not
need a limitation and is only limited by rank (and power level limitations). This entire paragraph is only the required
limitation of <a href="../variable-general.html">Variable</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">So for example if Doomsday (from DC comics) has Continuous Evolutionary Defense 7 (which costs
84 points) and is attacked by Superman's (from DC comics) heat vision which is Perception <a
href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> 5, Heat, Laser. After the initial toughness check Doomsday
can immediately use his Evolutionary Defense to gain <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> 5: Heat and <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> 5: Laser for a total of 30 points. The next time
Superman uses the same attack it is unlikely to succeed! But if Superman then uses Heat Vision 20 it will succeed (<a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> can't roll high enough). However Doomsday can only
spend a maximum of 35 points so the best he can do in response is <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> 11: Heat. (Note that the ranks given are examples
and do not estimate the maximum power of Doomsday or Superman.)</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You'll notice that this power is expensive. One option is to slow the action down although
that would limit the usefulness in combat. The advantage of it being a free action is that you can change your
defenses on your turn without interfering with your attacks. Also see the advantage <b>Persistent Information</b> in order to protect
the record of what has targeted you.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can always gain <a href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> to
natural age (because it is always affecting you). <a href="../enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced
Toughness's</a> maximum rank can only be raised by <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a>.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reactive</b>: In order to apply this flaw evolutionary defense must be Personal range with an action of Free.
The action type becomes reaction with a condition of being attacked. At that time you can put ranks
into resisting that attack (up to the attacking rank). You are not required to change your powers
when attacked therefore <b>Selective</b> is built in and can't be applied again. Natural age is always considered attacking you
so you can gain immunity to that at any time. You can lower the ranks of existing powers when you are attacked
or as a free action. You may end the effect as normal. This flaw makes evolutionary defense fairly useless
since the record is reset whenever the effect is ended. When evolutionary defense is first turned on it will have none
of the points spent (only natural age immunity is allowed) until you are attacked. <b>-2 cost per rank</b></div>
