<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#D9EAD3">
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../variable-general.html">Variable</a> Faster
Action 4 (Reaction), see description for required limitation <b>&#8226; 11 points per rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px">This <a href="../variable-general.html">Variable</a> can only put ranks
into one of the following: <a href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a>, <a
href="../enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Toughness</a>, and <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a>. <a
href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> or <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> can only resist against a specific descriptor that
has targeted you before (even if completely resisted). Each of them have a maximum rank up to the rank highest rank that
has targeted you before. <a href="../enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced Toughness</a> does not
need a limitation and is only limited by rank (and power level limitations). This entire paragraph is only the required
limitation of <a href="../variable-general.html">Variable</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">So for example if Doomsday (from DC comics) has Continuous Evolutionary Defense 7 (which costs
84 points) and is attacked by Superman's (from DC comics) heat vision which is Perception <a
href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> 5, Heat, Laser. After the initial toughness check Doomsday
can immediately use his Evolutionary Defense to gain <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> 5: Heat and <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> 5: Laser for a total of 30 points. The next time
Superman uses the same attack it is unlikely to succeed! But if Superman then uses Heat Vision 20 it will succeed (<a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> can't roll high enough). However Doomsday can only
spend a maximum of 35 points so the best he can do in response is <a
href="../resistance-defense.html">Resistance</a> 11: Heat. (Note that the ranks given are examples
and do not estimate the maximum power of Doomsday or Superman.)</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You'll notice that this power is very expensive. One option is to slow the action back down to
Full turn action to cost the normal 7 points per rank. The advantage of Reaction speed is that you can change your
defenses between attacks without taking a turn. Also see the advantage <b>Persistent Information</b> in order to protect
the record of what has targeted you.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can always gain <a href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> to
natural age (because it is always affecting you). <a href="../enhanced-trait-general.html">Enhanced
Toughness's</a> maximum rank can only be raised by <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a>.</div>
