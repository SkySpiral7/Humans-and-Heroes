<div style="padding:5px">You can overwhelm one of the target's senses, chosen when you take this effect. The target
makes a Fortitude or Will resistance check against your effect DC (choose one when you acquire the effect). One degree
of failure leaves the sense impaired (-1 penalty). Two degrees leave it disabled (-2 penalty) while three degrees leave
the sense unaware: The target automatically fails Perception checks involving the sense, and everything effectively has
total concealment from that sense.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The target makes a new resistance check at the end of each of his turns to recover. Success removes the
condition imposed by the Dazzle power. Failure means it persists.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Multiple Dazzle effects against the same sense are cumulative. If a target is already visually
disabled (second degree), for example, another Visual Dazzle with one degree of success leaves the target blind (visually unaware),
which is the same effect as a Visual Dazzle with 3 degrees of effect would do directly.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Dazzle effect can work on more than one sense at once; apply the Extra Condition modifier
for each additional sense affected.</div>
