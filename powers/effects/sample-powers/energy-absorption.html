<div style="padding:5px"><b>Effect</b>: Enhanced Trait, Fades, Reaction <b>&#8226; as base trait</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px">You take the energy from a particular type of attack, chosen when you take this power, and use
it to enhance one of your traits. Typically this is either Strength or a Ranged <a
href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> effect of the same energy type as the initial attack, but
other traits are possible, including Quickness, Regeneration, Speed, or the like. The enhancement to your trait is equal
to your power rank or the attack's rank, whichever is less.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The enhancement of the affected trait occurs automatically when you are subjected to the
attack. Thereafter, the enhanced trait fades at a rate of 1 point per round until it is gone. Further attacks can "top
off" your Enhanced Trait, restoring it to its full rank again, before it is completely faded. Your rank is the limit of
how much it can increase, however.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The Bouncer has rank 11 Energy Absorption
that applies the energy of kinetic attacks to Strength. If he's hit with <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> 5,
he gets +5 Strength. On the other hand, if he's hit with <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> 14, he only gets +11
Strength, the rank limit of his power. Thereafter, his enhanced Strength fades at 1 rank per round until it is back to its
normal, unenhanced, rank. However, if The Bouncer is hit again on the following turn for <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a>
4, he gains up to 4 ranks of Strength, up to his maximum again.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that this power does not provide any resistance to attacks; the character suffers the
effects of any attacks normally. Absorption often includes the additional effect of Protection (Impervious and often
Limited to the absorbed type of attack) or even <a href="../immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> to
the absorbed attack. Neither effect inhibits how Absorption works, they just make the absorbing character more resistant
to the incoming attack.</div>
