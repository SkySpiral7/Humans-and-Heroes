<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Effect</b>: Perception Ranged Move Object, Limited to Element <b>&#8226; 2 points per
rank</b></div>
<p>You can control and move a mass of an element like air, earth, or water. Your power's effective
Strength equals its rank, which is also the mass rank of the element you can move at once. So Earth Control 11 lets you
move up to 50 tons of earth and stone, for example.</p>
<p>Element Control is further refined with various Alternate Effects (see <b>Alternate
Effects</b>), expanding what you can do with your control. So Earth Control might let you kick up clouds of dust (Area
Visual <a href="../concealment-sensory.html">Concealment</a> Attack), build walls and other
structures of rock (Continuous Create), tunnel through the ground (Burrowing), or fly standing on a chunk
of rock (Platform <a href="../flight-movement.html">Flight</a>), to name a few. Alternate Effects
you do not add to your power as full-fledged modifiers are still available to you as power stunts using extra effort
(see <b>Powers Stunts</b>).</p>
