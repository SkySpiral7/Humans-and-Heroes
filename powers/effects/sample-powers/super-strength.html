<h1>SUPER-STRENGTH</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="power-lifting.html">Power-Lifting</a>, <a href="../leaping-movement.html">Leaping</a>,
<a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> (Strength-based) &#8226; <b>3 points per rank</b></span>
<p>You are strong! Each rank of <b>Super-Strength</b> gives you the effects of <a href="power-lifting.html">Power-Lifting</a>,
<a href="../leaping-movement.html">Leaping</a>, <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> (Strength-based). So with <b>Super-Strength</b> 10 you can lift and carry
rank 10 mass (26 tons), jump distance rank 8 (1.5 miles), and can attack with <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> 10 + strength.</p>
<p><a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> is still limited by power level limits so that it has a maximum effective rank,
at that point you can still put ranks in <a href="power-lifting.html">Power-Lifting</a> and <a href="../leaping-movement.html">Leaping</a> which have no maximum. You can buy the
three items separately: they do not need to be together this is simply a package for convenience and to demonstrate what
to buy to make a powerhouse (also see <a href="../../../secret-origins/powerhouse.html">Powerhouse</a>).</p>
<p>Heroes with <b>Super-Strength</b> often have additional powers based on their strength such as
a thunder clap (Ranged <a href="../affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>: dazed, stunned, deaf (auditorily unaware)) or a ground strike (see
<a href="../../../secret-origins/powerhouse.html">Powerhouse</a>). High stamina, fortitude, and toughness is also common
for super strong characters.</p>
