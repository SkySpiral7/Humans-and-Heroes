<p>You can generate and project a type of energy, such as cold, electricity, fire, kinetic force,
magnetism, radiation, or even cosmic energy, in a damaging blast (see the <b>Blast</b> power).</p>
<p>Energy Control is further defined by the addition of Alternate Effects (see <b>Alternate
Effects</b>), expanding what you can do with your control. For example, Cold Control might let you lower the surrounding
temperature (Environment - Cold) or trap targets in ice (<a
href="../affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>, see the <b>Snare</b> version). Magnetic Control
could let you manipulate metallic objects (Limited Move Object) while Electrical Control lets you generate an electrical
pulse to overload electronics (Burst Area <a href="../nullify-attack.html">Nullify</a> Electronics).
There is no limit on the number of Alternate Effects (aside from cost), however consider that some rarely used ones would
be better suited for <a href="../../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">Power Stunts</a>.</p>
