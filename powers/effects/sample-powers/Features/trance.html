<h3 class="generated-class-8">TRANCE</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../../feature-general.html">Feature</a>
<b>Action</b>: Full &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Concentration &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point
per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Through breathing and bodily control, you can slip into a deep trance. You must not be
interrupted while activating <b>Trance</b> meaning you can't take any actions between the standard and move actions
used. You are defenseless while in your <b>Trance</b> and being harmed will end the duration of the power as though it
was countered.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">While in the trance you add your Awareness rank to your Stamina rank to determine how long you
can hold your breath and you use the higher of your Fortitude or Will defenses for resistance checks against suffocation
(see Suffocation). Poison and disease effects are suspended for the duration of the trance. It requires a Perception
check with a DC equal to your Awareness check result to determine you're not dead because your bodily functions are so
slow.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are aware of your surroundings while in trance and can come out of it at any time.
You cannot take any actions while in the trance, but your GM may allow mental communication while in a trance. You are not
even allowed to take free actions although Reaction effects can still be triggered normally and if <b>Selective</b> you may
also decide if it should activate.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The action, range, and duration of this power cannot be changed with the exception of the slow
flaw below.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Awareness Check Required</b>: You must pass a DC 5 Awareness check to use this power. This
functions like a normal application of Check Required except that it starts with DC 5. You can't take any other
application of Check Required for Awareness until after you have this one, each one that follows increases the DC by 1.
All applications of Check Required (for any kind of check) must be passed or the power does not work. <b>Flat -1
point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Distracting</b>: You can't take this flaw because it is already included in the power.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Slow</b>: Going into a <b>Trance</b> takes at least a minute of uninterrupted meditation.
This is the only other action that <b>Trance</b> can have and its cost is different than normal due to it making the
power relatively useless. <b>-2 cost per rank.</b></div>
