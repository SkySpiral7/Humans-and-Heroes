<div style="padding:5px">You can stop on a dime: going from any speed to completely stopped in a single action. You must
be capable of moving to use this power so that <b>Flight</b> is required for someone who is falling and a person who is
immobile can't stop themself. You can't use this power while you are being dragged or carried: you must first escape the
grab. The action this feature takes ignores the action your movement would take and ignores your maximum speed. Using
this feature does not count twords the 2 movement limit per round so that you may completely stop then move twice if you
have enough actions.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Mobility Independent</b>: You may use this power at any time except while being grabbed.
This extra allows you to stop in mid-air without <b>Flight</b> even while immobile. However you must still escape a grab
before you are able to use it and you must still be able to take the action required. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
