<div style="padding:5px">You can stop on a dime: going from any speed to completely stopped in a single action. You must
be capable of moving to use this power so that <b>Flight</b> is required for someone who is falling and a person who is
immobile can't stop himself. You can't use this power while you are being dragged or carried: you must first escape the
grab. The action this feature takes ignores the action your movement would take and ignores your maximum speed. This
feature is not considered a movement power and thus is allowed to have an action of free.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Mobility Independent</b>: You may use this power at any time except while being grabbed.
This extra allows you to stop in mid-air without <b>Flight</b> even while immobile. However you must still escape a grab
before you are able to use it and you must still be able to take the action required. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
