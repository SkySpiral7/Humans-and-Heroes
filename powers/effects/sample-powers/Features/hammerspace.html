<p>You can store anything you carry in a pocket dimension. This does not increase the amount you
can carry but keeps your hands free and prevents stealing (since stealing anything from it would require dimension
travel, darkvision, and vacuum immunity). The pocket dimension is a vacuum and has all of the same dangers with these
differences: there is no radiation and there is no damage from heat. The pocket dimension is also small: its volume rank
is equal to the mass it can hold +2. Anything heavier or bigger can't enter the pocket dimension. The space loops
around. When you withdraw from it you always get the item you desire. You can only store objects that you are touching
and items withdrawn must appear in your hand so that if you don't have an available hand then you can't withdraw any
more. For balance reasons you can't use this on living subjects that are not willing, you can't use this to escape ropes
etc (by storing them), you can't change its range, and you can't use this to disarm anyone. Also see <b>Move Object</b>
and <b>Teleport Attack</b> to move objects closer or further away. Note that if this is made into a bag then anyone can
steal from it if they can reach in the bag.</p>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<p><b>Increased Mass</b>: Your pocket dimension can hold 1 rank more mass and grows 1 rank of
volume. This is above your normal carrying capacity which is based on strength. <b>Flat +3 points per
application.</b></p>
<p><b>Non-hostile Environment</b>: You can store air and temperature in your pocket dimension. By
default it is filled with standard Earth air (1 atmosphere pressure) at room tempurature (70 degrees Fahrenheit). As a
free action you can change the air and temperature to match the environment you are currently in. <b>Flat +1
point.</b></p>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<p><b>Mass Included</b>: Your total mass includes what you have stored and you can feel the weight
you carry. <b>Flat -1 point.</b></p>
