<div style="padding:5px"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../../feature-general.html">Feature</a>
<b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 3 points per
rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You feel no pain. Regeneration and Immortality powers still feel pain by default and because of
this you may pass out from shear pain or shock even if your HP remains positive. Pain isn't felt if damage isn't dealt
and thus characters with high toughness don't have this problem. This feature removes that problem. You still have
tactile sense. Technically you still feel pain but you can ignore it to the highest degree that you are completely
immune to even the highest forms of physical torture but only against natural pain not <b>illusions</b> or
<b>afflictions</b>. Meaning an Affliction power with pain descriptor will surpass this feature. If you'd like a less
extreme version of this instead put ranks into <b>Resistance</b> (to pain). This also covers other senses such as very
bitter or bad smell this does not make you resistance to anything <b>Sense-Dependent</b>. You can't be immune to mental
torture, instead put ranks into Will defense.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Surgery needs to be performed on Mr. Gun to
remove his appendix. To make a point he decides to go without pain killers of any fashion since he is immune to pain
anyway. He is conscious and completely tactilely aware the entire time but doesn't even flinch. However Mr. Gun's heart
beating at regular speed causes bleeding during the process making the surgery much more difficult and caused substantial
blood loss.</div>
