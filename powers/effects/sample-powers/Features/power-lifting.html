<b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per
rank</span>
<p>Your lifting and carrying capacity is out of proportion with the rest of your Strength. Each
rank in this power gives you +1 to your Strength rank for determining how much weight you can lift and carry, but does
not increase your Strength damage, strength checks (including skills) except for lifting, or other effects of your
Strength rank.</p>
<p>Although based on <b>Enhanced Strength</b> this power is much cheaper, this is done so that it
is affordable to buy <b>Super-Strength</b>.</p>
