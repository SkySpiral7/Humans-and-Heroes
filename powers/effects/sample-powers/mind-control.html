href="../affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>, Resisted by Will &#8226; <b>5 points per
rank</b></span>
<p>You can impose your will on others, forcing them to obey your commands. Targets failing a Will
resistance check against your effect DC first become dazed, then compelled, as they try to fight off your influence.
Finally, with three or more degrees of effect, the target becomes controlled and obeys any commands you give.</p>
<p>Degrees of failure on resistance checks against Mind Control are cumulative. You can also apply
the Progressive modifier (see <a href="../affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> effect) so your
mental hold increases each time the target fails a resistance check against it!</p>
