rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are fast! Each rank of <b>Super-Speed</b> gives you the effects of <b>Improved
Initiative</b> as an <b>Enhanced Trait</b>, <b>Quickness</b>, and <b>Ground Speed</b>, with a ground speed rank equal to
your power rank. So with <b>Super-Speed</b> 5, for example, you have +10 to initiative checks (the maximum), can perform
routine actions normally requiring two hours in just 4 minutes, and have a ground speed of 60 miles per hour.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Improved Initiative</b> has a maximum rank of 5 but <b>Quickness</b> and <b>Ground Speed</b>
have no maximum. So <b>Super-Speed</b> 20 would cost 45 character points for <b>Enhanced Initiative</b> 5,
<b>Quickness</b> 20, and <b>Ground Speed</b> 20. If this is too confusing buy the three items separately: they do not
need to be together this is simply a package for convenience and to demonstrate what to buy to make a speedster (also
see <a href="../../../secret-origins/speedster.html">Speedster</a>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Heroes with <b>Super-Speed</b> often have additional powers based on their speed, particularly
things like Air Control (whipping up powerful winds, see <b>Element Control</b>, previously) or modifiers to their
Strength <a href="../damage-attack.html">Damage</a> like Area or Multiattack to represent the
ability to make a rapid series of attacks in a single turn. High (possibly Enhanced) active defenses are also common for
characters with <b>Super-Speed</b>.</div>
