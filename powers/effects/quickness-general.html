<div class="under-the-hood">
<div>Under the Hood: Quickness</div>
<div>
<div style="padding:5px">Quickness, like many power effects, is not especially realistic; it allows you to do things
like disassemble an entire car as a free action at a high enough rank (around rank 13-14), but doesn't have any effect
on how many attacks you can make on your turn. Why? Two reasons: mainly because allowing any character potentially
thousands of attacks per turn would slow down the game and be hugely unbalancing (to say the least). Secondly that's
how superhuman quickness works in the comics: speedsters do routine things in the blink of an eye,
but in fights they don't really act more often than anyone else. See <a
href="sample-powers/super-speed.html">Super-Speed</a> for some examples of the super-fast attacks speedsters might
have, in addition to their Quickness.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can perform routine tasks--anything that can be done as a routine check (see <b>Routine
Checks</b> in <a href="../../the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a>)--fast, perhaps very fast. Subtract your effect rank from the
normal time rank to perform a task to determine how long it takes you. So, for example, if you have Quickness 7, a
routine task normally taking an hour (time rank 9) takes you (9 - 7 = time rank 2) 30 seconds. Non-routine checks are
not affected by Quickness, nor is movement speed.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you can perform a task in less than a second (time rank -2), the GM may choose to treat that
task as a free action for you (although the GM can still limit the number of free actions you can accomplish in a turn
as usual).</div>
