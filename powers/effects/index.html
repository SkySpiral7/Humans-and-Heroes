<div class="page-header-blue">POWER EFFECTS</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<div style="padding:5px">Players spend character points on various powers for their heroes, like acquiring skills or
other traits. A power is made up of one or more <b>effects</b>, possibly with different <b>modifiers</b>, which increase
or decrease the cost of the effects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Effects can be used to create any number of different powers. A hero with the <a
href="concealment-sensory.html">Concealment</a> effect could use it to create a power called
Blending, Blur, Cloak, Invisibility, Shadowmeld, or anything else appropriate to the character you wish to play. It's
all a matter of how powerful the effect is and what modifiers have been placed on it to increase or decrease its
performance. Another way to think of it is that this book is filled with effects, but your character sheet is filled
with powers.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-POWER-COSTS">POWER COSTS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Power effects are acquired in ranks, like ranks for other traits. The more ranks an effect has,
the greater its effect. Each effect of a power has a standard cost per rank.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-EXCLUSIVE-PURPOSE">EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">As noted in the side bar Creative Uses of Descriptors (see <a
href="../descriptors.html">Descriptors</a>) there is a difference between being creative to accomplish a small task and
using a power for something it is not intended for. If there is no real impact on the game then just let it be but for
other uses a power stunt is required through extra effort. The Rule of Exclusive Purpose states that each base power has
a unique purpose, meaning that other base powers can't provide the same functionality without a <a
href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">power stunt</a>. Even though you could <a
href="transform-control.html">Transform</a> air into acid, for example, you need a power
stunt to deal damage with it because that would be the <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> power. Also see <a
href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT">Alternate Effect</a> for related effects that can be used more often then power
stunts. The exception to this are catch alls like Movement: even though Flight is a type of movement, the base power
Movement is only used to cover all other kinds of movement. Feature doesn't have much purpose. Variable is a sort of an
exception in that its direct purpose is to provide other powers. Insubstantial can be used as Permeate without a power
stunt, Protection has the same purpose as Enhanced Trait: Toughness, and Regeneration has the same purpose as
healing.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">EFFECT TYPES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Power effects fall into certain categories or <b>effect types</b>. Effects of the same type
follow similar rules and provide descriptors for certain other effects. This section discusses the different effect
types and the rules governing them.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ATTACK">ATTACK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Attack</b> effects are used offensively in combat. They require an attack check and damage,
hinder, or otherwise harm their target in some way. Attack effects require a standard action to use. Their duration is
usually instant although their results--whether damage or some other hindrance--may linger until the target recovers.
Attack effects always allow for a resistance check.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CONTROL">CONTROL</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Control</b> effects grant the user influence over something, from the environment to the
ability to move objects or even create them out of thin air. Control effects require a standard action to initiate, but
can then usually be sustained. Control effects used against unwilling targets usually require an attack check and allow
a resistance check, the same for the hazards they are capable of causing, such as creating intense cold or dropping a
heavy object on someone.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEFENSE">DEFENSE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Defense</b> effects protect in various ways, typically offering a bonus to resistance
checks, or granting outright immunity to particular effects or conditions. Most defense effects work only on the user
and are subtle and permanent, functioning at all times. Some are activated and sustained as a free action, meaning they
can switch on or off, but can potentially leave the user unprotected.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-GENERAL">GENERAL</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>General</b> effects don't fit into any other particular category. They're not governed by
any special rules other than those given in the effect's description.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MOVEMENT">MOVEMENT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Movement</b> effects allow characters to get around in various ways. Some provide a speed
rank with a particular form of movement--such as ground, air, or water--while others offer different modes of movement,
like walking on walls or slithering along the ground like a snake.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Although activating a movement effect is typically a free action, the character must still take
a move action in order to actually move using the effect. So, for example, the action of the <a
href="flight-movement.html">Flight</a> effect is "free" and activating it grants the
character a <a href="flight-movement.html">Flight</a>speed rank equal to the effect rank.
Moving that speed rank still requires a move action, however.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SENSORY">SENSORY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sensory</b> effects enhance or alter the senses. Some sensory effects improve the user's
senses while others grant entirely new senses or fool the senses in some way. Sensory effects are typically a free
action to activate and sustain, or are permanent and always in effect.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-SENSE-TYPES">SENSE TYPES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Senses are grouped into <b>sense types</b>, descriptors for how different sensory effects work.
The sense types, and some of the senses included in them, are:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Visual</b>: normal sight, darkvision, infravision, low-light vision, microscopic vision,
ultravision, X-Ray vision</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Auditory</b>: normal hearing, sonar (accurate ultrasonic), ultrasonic hearing</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Olfactory</b>: normal smell and taste, scent</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Tactile</b>: normal touch, tremorsense</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Radio</b>: radio, radar (accurate radio)</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Mental</b>: mental awareness, Mind Reading, Precognition, Postcognition</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Exotic</b>: This is the catchall for other sensory descriptors not given above, including
unusual senses or descriptors like cosmic, gravitic, magical, and so forth.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">HOW POWERS WORK</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Using powers is a fairly simple matter. Some power effects work automatically.
Others--particularly those affecting other people--require some effort to use, like an attack check or a power check.
Powers affecting others allow resistance checks against their effects.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-POWER-CHECKS">POWER CHECKS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">In some cases, you may be required to make an <b>power check</b> to determine how well an
effect works. A power check is just like any other check: 3dF, plus the power's rank, plus any applicable modifiers,
against a difficulty class set by the Gamemaster. The results of various power checks are described below.</div>
<div class="generated-class-5">Power Check = 3dF + rank + modifiers vs. difficulty class</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ROUTINE-POWER-CHECKS">ROUTINE POWER CHECKS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Many power effects allow for routine checks involving their use, generally specified in the
effect's description (see <b>Routine Checks</b> in <a href="../../the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a>).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-OPPOSED-POWER-CHECKS">OPPOSED POWER CHECKS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">In some cases, usually when one effect is used directly against another, or against a
particular trait like an ability or skill, an opposed check is called for (see <b>Opposed Checks</b> in <a
href="../../the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a>). Each player performs a power check and the higher result wins (ties go to the higher
rank power).</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-EFFECT-PARAMETERS">EFFECT PARAMETERS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Each effect has certain <b>parameters</b> that describe the time needed to use the effect, the
subject or target, the distance it works at, and so forth. The basic effect parameters are Action, Range, and
Duration.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ACTION">ACTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Using or activating an effect requires a particular amount of time. See <b>Actions</b>, for
details about the different types of actions. Modifiers may change the action needed to use an effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Slow</b>: Using the effect can't effectively be done in combat because it takes at least 10
rounds (1 minute). Generally these tasks take at least 5 minutes.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Full</b>: Using the effect requires a full turn action which means it takes both a standard
action and a move action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Standard</b>: Using the effect requires a standard action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Move</b>: Using the effect requires a move action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Free</b>: It requires a free action to use or activate the effect. Once an effect is
activated or deactivated, it remains so until your next turn. As with all free actions, the GM may limit the total
number of effects a hero can turn on or off in a turn.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reaction</b>: It requires no action to use the effect. It operates automatically in
response to something else, such as an attack.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>None</b>: It requires no action to use the effect. It is always active.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RANGE">RANGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Each effect has a default range, which may be changed by modifiers.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Personal</b>: The effect works only on you, the user.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Close</b>: The effect can target anyone or anything you touch. Touching an unwilling subject
requires an unarmed attack check against the subject's Parry.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Ranged</b>: The effect works at a distance, limited by perception and path and requiring a
ranged attack check against the subject's Dodge defense. A ranged effect has a short range of distance rank 0 (30 ft), a
medium range of short range +1 (distance rank 1 = 60 ft) and a long range of short range +2 (distance rank 2 = 120 ft).
Ranged attack checks at medium range suffer a -1 circumstance penalty, while ranged attacks at long range suffer a -2
circumstance penalty. See <a href="../../action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a> for details.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Perception</b>: The effect works on any target you can perceive with an accurate sense,
without any need for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive the target, you cannot affect it.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DURATION">DURATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Each effect lasts for a particular amount of time, which may be changed by modifiers. Any
effect that is currently active (impossible for Instant duration) can't be used again until the duration ends. To get
around this see the Split extra.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Instant</b>: When used, the effect occurs and ends in the same turn, although its results
may linger.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Concentration</b>: You can keep a concentration effect going by taking a standard action
each round to do so. If you are incapable of taking the necessary action, or simply choose not to, the effect
ends.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sustained</b>: You can keep a sustained effect going by taking a free action each round to
do so. If you are incapable of taking the necessary action, or simply choose not to, the effect ends.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Continuous</b>: The effect lasts as long as you wish, without any action required on your
part. Once active, it stays that way until you choose to deactivate it (a free action).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Permanent</b>: The effect is always active and cannot be deactivated, even if you want to. A
permanent effect cannot be improved using extra effort. A permanent effect cannot make a power check and is considered
to have rolled a 0 instead (like a Routine check).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RESISTANCE-CHECK">RESISTANCE CHECK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Effects targeting other characters allow a resistance check. The defense used and the
difficulty class depend on the effect and its modifiers.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Willing characters can forgo their resistance check against an effect, if they wish. This
includes characters who think they're receiving a beneficial effect, even if they're not! You can't forgo Toughness
checks, but you may choose to discontinue the use of effects with a duration of Continuous or Sustained that grant a
Toughness bonus in order to lower your resistance.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The <a href="immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a> effect allows
characters to ignore certain effects altogether, removing the need for a resistance check.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">COUNTERING EFFECTS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">In some circumstances the effects of one power may counter another, negating it. Generally for
two effects to counter each other they must have opposed descriptors. For example, light and darkness powers can counter
each other as can heat and cold, water and fire, and so forth. In some cases, such as magical or mental effects, powers
of the same descriptor can also counter each other. The GM is the final arbiter as to whether or not an effect with a
particular descriptor can counter another. The <a href="nullify-attack.html">Nullify
effect</a> can counter any effect of a particular descriptor!</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-HOW-COUNTERING-WORKS">HOW COUNTERING WORKS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">To counter an effect, you must take the <b>ready action</b>. In doing so, you wait to complete
your action until your opponent tries to use a power. You may still move, since ready is a standard action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You must be able to use the readied effect as a standard action or less. Reaction effects
may counter at any time without readying an action. Effects that have a slow action
cannot counter during action rounds (although they may be able to counter ongoing effects, see the
following section).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If an opponent attempts to use a power you are able to counter, use your countering effect as
your readied action. You and the opposing character make power checks (3dF + rank). If you win, your two powers cancel
each other out and there is no effect from either. If the opposing character wins, your attempt to counter is
unsuccessful. The opposing effect works normally.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Thetis, goddess of the seas, is fighting the
Silver Knight. Thetis readies an action as her player says she wants to counter Silver Knight's fire blast with her water powers
and the GM agrees the two powers should be able to counter each other. Then the hate-mongering villain hurls a blast of
white-hot fire (a Ranged <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> effect) which Thetis tries to counter.
The GM asks Thetis's player to make a Water Control power check, while he makes a Fire Control power
check for Silver Knight. Thetis's player rolls a result of 10 while the GM rolls a result of 7 for Silver Knight. Thetis
successfully counters the flame blast, which fizzles out in a gout of steam.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-COUNTERING-ONGOING-EFFECTS">COUNTERING ONGOING EFFECTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can also use one power to counter the ongoing effect of another, or other lingering results
of an instant effect (like flames ignited by a fiery <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a>
effect). You must be within range of the affected target (including created object etc) not the one who caused it. This
requires a normal use of the countering effect and an opposed check, as above. If you are successful, you negate the
effect (although the opposing character can attempt to reestablish it normally). Poison, Disease, and Being on Fire can
be countered like an affliction but conditions caused by physical conditions such as ropes causing Immobile or low HP
causing incapacitation can't be countered. Conditions and effects with duration more then instant are the only ones that
can be ended, reversible instant effects can't be reversed by countering them. Activated effects can be deactivated but
otherwise when a permanent effect is countered it is reactivated during the next round (6 seconds later) as a
reaction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mindmaster has placed Johnny Comet under his
mental control (an <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> effect). Lady Justice has
the power to break such bonds (the <a href="nullify-attack.html">Nullify</a> effect). She
shines the light of liberty on her teammate and makes a power check (3dF + her <a
href="nullify-attack.html">Nullify</a> rank). The GM makes a check of 3dF + Mindmaster's <a
href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> rank. If Lady Justice wins, Johnny is free of
Mindmaster's control. If she fails, the Victory League will have to come up with another plan to neutralize their super-fast
teammate without hurting him.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A permanent duration power can be countered as though it had continuous duration. If such
countering succeeds then there will be <b>Power Loss</b> of that power for 1 round at which point it is
instantly reactivated. Note that for other ongoing effects the duration ends instead of <b>Power Loss</b>. In order to
cause <b>Power Loss</b> of a trait that doesn't have permanent duration you must use <a
href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a>.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-INSTANT-COUNTERING">INSTANT COUNTERING</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can spend a victory point to attempt to counter another power as a reaction, without the
need to ready an action to do so. See <b>victory points</b> for details.</div>
