<div style="padding:5px">You can use victory points (including those provided by the <a
href="../../advantages.html#TOC-LUCKY">Lucky</a> advantage) to affect others in various ways (see <b>victory
points</b>). Please note that people will not dismiss this as just superstition since its usage is clearly visible
unless you apply the subtle modifier. When choosing this power choose one of the following capabilities: Good luck to allies,
Good luck for yourself, or Bad luck to enemies (each have multiple effects).</div>
<ul>
<li><div style="padding:5px"><u>Good luck to allies</u>. You can spend a victory point on another character's behalf, with the normal benefits and
restrictions. <b>Reaction condition</b>: someone else spending a victory point.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px"><u>Good luck to allies</u>. You can bestow your victory point on others. You can use this only once on any given character
in a round, but the recipient may use the bestowed point(s) normally but will lose it when victory points reset (as normal).
A special victory point from Lucky must still follow the same restriction.
<b>Reaction condition</b>: None: unlike the other possible effects, this one can only be used as a Free action rather than Reaction.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px"><u>Good luck for yourself</u>. You can cause something normally out of your
control to happen or to randomly pick correctly among choices. Without spending a victory point you can guarantee
success when the odds at least 1 in 2 (50%) in your favor. This can only be used for a single event at a time. For example
if you flip 2 coins at the same time you can force them to land on the same sides but can't choose whether it is heads or tails.
<b>Reaction condition</b>: when any random
event occurs that doesn't involve rolling fudge dice. This condition is intentionally vague so that the character
may control anything that the GM considers likely. This can't be used for any skill check etc.</div>
<li><div style="padding:5px"><u>Good luck for yourself</u>. You can spend a victory point to cause something normally out of your
control to happen or to randomly pick correctly among choices. For this use you must spend a victory point to get guarantee
success when the odds are 1 in 100 (1%). For each victory point spent multiply the odds by 100 (1 in 10,000 (0.01%) etc)
with a maximum of 1 in 10 billion (0.000 000 01%) with 5 victory points. <b>Reaction condition</b>: when any random
event occurs that doesn't involve rolling fudge dice. This condition is intentionally vague so that the character
may control anything that the GM considers possible but unlikely. This can't do the impossible (0% chance) and
can't be used for any skill check etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mr. Impossible, as a parlor trick, hands the
customer a deck of cards and tells her to shuffle it while thinking of a card, he then spends a victory point to
have the top card on the deck exactly the card she was thinking of.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px"><u>Bad luck to enemies</u>. You can spend one of your victory point to negate someone else's use of a victory point
(including those from the Lucky advantage). Spending a special victory point in
this way can only negate the use of a victory point used to Improve Roll (even if a special one wasn't used for it).
You and your opponent may do this any number of times.
<b>Reaction condition</b>: someone else spending a victory point.</div></li>
<li><div style="padding:5px"><u>Bad luck to enemies</u>. You can spend a victory point (including special ones) to force someone else to reroll a dice
roll and take the worse of the two rolls. Before rolling the target may spend a victory point (including special ones)
to counter this usage of Luck Control (the target does not need the Luck Control power to do this).
You and your opponent may do this any number of times.
<b>Reaction condition</b>: someone else rolling fudge dice for any reason.</div></li>
</ul>
<div style="padding:5px">There are no refunds if a spent victory point's effect is negated (via Luck Control or otherwise).
All options except the second can in turn be negated by another's
Luck Control. As normal, <a href="nullify-attack.html">Nullify</a> can negate any of the uses of Luck Control.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters can't be compelled or controlled to use extra effort or victory points which means
that you can't be forced to use Luck Control: your luck might fail you but it will never turn against you.
Despite having an action of Reaction, Luck Control requires you to be conscious and choose to activate
the effect (it never functions while you are unconscious and never without permission).
Therefore the <b>Selective</b> extra is built in and can't be applied again.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Area</b>: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets in the affected area. You
spend a victory point for each subject. If you can't afford affecting each character within range then the closest ones
(the Gamemaster's choice) are affected first until no more can be affected. You must apply the same effect to all
subjects at once. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reduced Range</b>: Luck Control normally requires no attack check; if Ranged or Close range,
it does. <b>-1 cost per rank per application.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Side Effect</b>: As a particular side effect of Luck Control, if your effort to alter luck
fails, you lose another victory point (not a special one). If you do not have another normal victory point then the next
time you would receive one it is automatically taken effectively the GM gains a "free" complication against you. You
can't use Luck Control again until your debt is repaid. <b>On Failure: -1 cost per rank; Always Happens: -2 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Slower Action</b>: If the action required for Luck Control is slowed down any, it is only
usable during your turn each round, which limits its usefulness in responding to the actions of others. <b>-1 cost per
rank per application.</b></div>
</div></div>
