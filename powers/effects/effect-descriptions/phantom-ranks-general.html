<div style="padding:5px">You can temporarily make a power, chosen when you take this effect, more resistent to being
countered. While this effect is active, each rank in <b>Phantom Ranks</b> counts as ranks for that power when performing
a power check to resist being countered. This doesn't count for power checks used to counter another power, power checks
against <b>Resistance</b>, or any other kind of power check. The reason why a character would buy <b>Phantom Ranks</b>
instead of simply more ranks of that power is because <b>Phantom Ranks</b> are not limited by power level limits. Some
effects have <b>Phantom Ranks</b> built in, such as having more than 4 ranks of <a
href="insubstantial-general.html">Insubstantial</a>, in which case the <b>Phantom Ranks</b> are Permanent duration and
can't be modified. So, for example, <b>Insubstantial</b> 7 allows you to become Incorporeal but is harder to <a
href="nullify-attack.html">Nullify</a> than <b>Insubstantial</b> 4 would be, on the other hand you could also have
<b>Insubstantial</b> 1 with 6 <b>Phantom Ranks</b> to become a fluid-like form and be equally resistant to
<b>Nullify</b> (or other countering powers).</div>
