<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="effect-defense-regeneration">REGENERATION (DEFENSE)</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 3 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You recover quickly from damage. Recover you rank in HP every minute (10 rounds) spread out as
evenly as possible. So with Regeneration 5, you regain 1 HP every other round, every round with Regeneration 10, and 2
HP per round with Regeneration 20. Each of the modifiers that Healing has can also be applied to Regeneration except
Resurrection since duration ends upon death, instead see Immortality.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REGENERATION-ABSENT-STAMINA">REGENERATION ABSENT STAMINA</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters with no Stamina do not heal (see <b>Absent Abilities</b> in <b>Abilities</b>). One
or more ranks of Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate;
additional Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Persistent</b>: You can regenerate even Incurable damage or afflictions (if you also have
Restorative) of equal or lower rank than the number of Persistent ranks (see the Incurable modifier). If the affliction
effect is of greater rank then instead the condition's effect rank is subtracted by your persistent rank for determining
other forms of healing, natural or otherwise. If the damage effect is of greater rank then your regeneration can't
affect that damage at all. <b>Flat +1 point per application.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Precise</b>: You have fine control over your Regeneration so that you can choose what is
healed first instead of the most severe. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Regenerative</b>: You can can regenerate limbs and other parts that wouldn't normally heal.
This creates new body parts (from nothing) using the current body parts as a base. There must be at least a single
living cell used as base material. The mass rank that you are missing is equal to the amount of HP you need to
substitute. For each 1 HP that would be recovered reduces the mass rank needed by 1 thus each 1 HP instead creates half
of the missing mass. If the mass missing is rank 0 instead all of it is regenerated. The GM may use volume if mass is
not appropriate. This is more severe than recovering HP or conditions so that it will be done first. <b>+1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Restorative</b>: Your Regeneration can remove afflictions. HP that would be restored is
instead (if it is more severe) used as a defense bonus for recovering from that affliction instead of recovering that
much HP. For conditions that aren't afflictions: tenderized penalty is 1 HP each and <a
href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a> is 1 HP per point recovered. This has no effect on Bound, Restrained, HP conditions
and those imposed by circumstances such as a sticky floor. This also can't undo Mind Switch or Mental Transform. <b>+1
cost per rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Source</b>: Your Regeneration only works when you have access to a particular source to
replenish yourself, such as blood, electricity, sand, scrap metal, sunlight, and so forth. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sudden</b>: Instead of gaining HP each round you only recover during your turn. You still
recover the same amount of HP you would without this flaw. For another application you can have it happen suddenly every
minute instead. <b>Turn: -1 cost per rank. Minute: -2 cost per rank</b></div>
</div></div>
