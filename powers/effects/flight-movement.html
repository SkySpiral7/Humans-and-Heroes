<h1>FLIGHT (MOVEMENT)</h1>

<p>You can fly through the air, including hovering in place. You have a flight speed rank equal to
your effect rank.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Aquatic</b>: You can move underwater almost as easily as in the air. This modifier allows
your <b>Flight</b> ranks to be used as ranks in <a href="movement-movement.html#TOC-SWIMMING">Movement: Swimming</a> but
much cheaper than an Alternate Effect. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Continuous</b>: Continuous <b>Flight</b> operates even when the user is incapacitated or
otherwise unable to sustain it. The user remains hanging in the air, maintaining relative position to the ground, if
necessary. Alternately, the user might float safely down to the ground when unable to maintain <b>Flight</b> as a kind
of "safety net," your choice when you apply the modifier. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Subtle</b>: The default <b>Flight</b> effect is noticeable, whether from the rush of air,
the roar of jets, or a glowing contrail or aurora, for example. This modifier reduces, and then eliminates, these
traces. If your <b>Flight</b> is completely Subtle, you do not need to make Stealth checks to move silently while flying
(you do so automatically), although you may still need to do so to avoid being seen or otherwise detected. Even if the
power of <b>Flight</b> is undetectable people who see you fly can easily conclude that it is due to this power. <b>Flat
+1 or 2 points. See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-SUBTLE">Subtle modifier</a> for more details.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Gliding</b>: You fly by gliding on wind currents. Your maximum gliding distance is limited
to the vertical distance rank of your starting height, plus your flight speed rank. You may be able to gain altitude
occasionally by catching thermal updrafts and winds at the GM's discretion. Other-wise you must land at the end of your
maximum distance. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Levitation</b>: You can only move vertically, straight up and down, and not side to side,
although you can allow yourself to be carried along in the direction of the wind horizontally. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Platform</b>: Your Flight is reliant on some sort of platform on which you stand or sit. If
you fail a defense check while flying, or you are grabbed by someone standing on the ground, you're knocked or pulled
off your platform and cannot fly. You can regain the use of your flying platform by reactivating your Flight effect on
your next turn. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Wings</b>: You have wings that allow you to fly, but they run the risk of being fouled or
restrained, which prevents you from flying. If you are immobilized, restrained, or bound, you cannot fly. You can regain
the use of your wings by reactivating your Flight effect once you are no longer affected by the aforementioned
conditions. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
