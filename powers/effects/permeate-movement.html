<h1>PERMEATE (MOVEMENT)</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Action</b>: Move &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</span>
<p>You can pass through solid objects as if they weren't there. You remain solid while using
Permeate but the object moves around you (becoming temporarily more dense in certain places) so if you are inside an
object when Permeate is deactivated you can't move but, unlike <a href="insubstantial-general.html">Insubstantial</a>,
don't take damage from it. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or collapses behind you immediately (your
choice when you begin down each new tunnel). Material density is equal to Material toughness for simplicity (see table
below). You move through any material that has a material density equal to or less than your strength, moving at a speed
equal to the difference plus your Permeate rank minus 5. To pass through material that has a material toughness greater
than your strength you are attacking it moving at 1 inch per 6 seconds. If the material has a material toughness greater
than your strength+20 you can't Permeate through it at all. The maximum speed you can move is equal to your effective
movement speed if there wasn't any material in the way. For example, Permeate 8 with Strength 2 and <a
href="flight-movement.html">Flight</a> 4 would let you move through soil at speed rank 5 (around 60 MPH) but caps out at
your maximum movement speed of 4 (30 MPH). While inside an object Permeate effectively provides a <a
href="flight-movement.html">Platform Flight</a> but only if you close the tunnels behind you. Also note that being
inside an object provides cover and possibly concealment. And in the case of total cover, the cover needs to be
destroyed before you can be damaged.</p>

<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h2>
<p><b>Not Strength Based</b>: Permeate uses the same form as above but replace all references to
strength with 0 and attack checks are never required (a power check might be required in certain circumstances) although
your speed is still the same. The reason why the default is Strength Based is because it is easier to explain this way.
The reason why this is a free modifier is the same reason as strength-based damage: if your strength is hindered so is
the effect. <b>+0</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Limited</b>: Permeate may be limited to certain circumstances or materials, such as only
loose sand and soil (leaving the character unable to burrow through dense clay or solid rock). <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
