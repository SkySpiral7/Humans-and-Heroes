<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: As base Trait</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can temporarily improve one of your existing traits, chosen when you take this effect.
While this effect is active, you increase the affected trait by its rank. So, for example, Enhanced Strength 5 increases
your Strength by +5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to power level limits, so your unenhanced
rank must be below the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement to accommodate it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquiring a rank in the affected trait. The
key differences are that Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait, and as an effect it can be
combined with extra effort and other effects. Toughness can be Enhanced using this power (there is no other way to put
ranks into toughness) at the base cost of 1 point per rank. See <a href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-EXTRA-EFFORT">Extra Effort</a>
and <a href="../../abilities.html#TOC-ENHANCED-ABILITIES">Enhanced Abilities</a> for more.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Enhanced Trait can be used for any trait except powers which means that can be used for <a href="../../abilities.html">Abilities</a>,
<a href="../../advantages.html">Advantages</a>, <a href="../../skills.html">Skills</a>, and <a href="../../abilities.html#TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">Defense</a>
but not <a href="../index.html">Powers</a>, <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-REMOVABLE">Devices</a>, or <a href="../../gadgets-gear/index.html">Equipment</a>.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Decreased Duration (Permanent)</b>: Enhanced Trait can be made permanent as normal.
The difference between a Permanent Enhanced Trait and buying the trait directly is that the Enhanced Trait is considered
a power. Like all powers it can be <a href="nullify-attack.html">Nullified</a>, <a href="sample-powers/mimic.html">Mimiced</a>,
and is subject to a <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-POWER-LOSS">power loss</a>
<a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-OTHER-COMPLICATIONS">complication</a>.<b>+0 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited</b>: Enhanced Traits are often Limited in some fashion, such as Nighttime (or
Daytime) Only, While Angry (or in another emotional state), Underwater (or in some other environment), and so forth. A
limit that rarely comes into play--like losing your Enhanced Trait during a new moon--can be handled as a power loss
complication. See <b>Complications</b> in <a href="../../the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a> for details. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reduced Trait</b>: One or more of your traits is lowered while others are enhanced. This
flaw is worth as many points as the reduction in the affected trait(s). So, for example, if you lose Intellect while you
gain in Strength, treat the value of the lost Intellect ranks as the value of the flaw. As with all flaws, the effect
must still cost at least 1 character point. <b>-Flat points equal to the lowered trait.</b></div>
