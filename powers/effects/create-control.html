<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#F4CCCC">
<div style="padding:5px">Create and <a href="summon-minion-control.html">Summon Minion</a> are similar effects: both "create" things
out of nowhere. So when should a character have one and not the other?</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while <a href="summon-minion-control.html">Summon Minion</a>
conjures creatures of some sort, capable of independent action (albeit limited in the case of mindless creatures like
robots or zombies). So a character able to create "sculptures" of ice, for example: walls, slides, columns, and so
forth, should have Create. A character able to call up animated snowmen, on the other hand, should have Summon, while a
powerful "ice elemental" may very well have both effects!</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="generated-class-18">
<div class="generated-class-1">Under the Hood: Anti Matter and Dark Matter</div>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#F4CCCC">
<div style="padding:5px">Dark Matter does nothing except increase mass which can be done instead with a <a href="sample-powers/heavy.html">Heavy</a>
Attack. Anti-matter explodes as soon as it touches regular matter, such as air, so instead use a Area Burst <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> effect with descriptors.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can form solid objects essentially out of nowhere. This power essentially has two durations
the first being Instant which creates the object and the second being the duration shown above for maintaining the
object. They may be made of solidified energy, "hardened" water or air, transmuted bulk matter, ice, stone, or some
other medium, depending on the effect's descriptors. They must be made out of a single material choosen when this power
is obtained. If you want to be able to create any material you will need to use <a
href="transform-control.html">Transform</a> type 3 (a single target into any of a broad group). They can be solid or
hollow, opaque or translucent, as you choose when you use the effect, limited by your descriptors and the Gamemaster's
judgment. The created objects have the single color of whatever they are made out of. You can never create life or
transform an object to gain life. They can't be transparent without the subtle modifier.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can form any simple geometric shape or common object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer,
lens, disk, etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular object is too complex for this effect. Generally,
your objects can't have any moving parts more complex than a hinge. If you want to be able to create more complex shapes
you will need to pass an Artistry (Awe) skill check if you want it created as that shape or create it then pass an
Artistry (Dex) skill check to craft it from the raw materials. If you want to be able to create working objects from a
single material you will need to pass a Technology (Awe) or Engineering (Awe) skill check if you want it created as that
shape otherwise see the rules for creating devices from raw materials.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can create an object with a maximum Toughness equal to your effect rank and mass rank 0 (50
lbs). For more mass see the modifier Increased Mass. Note that this power is an exception to the assumption that
material toughness equals mass. Created objects can be damaged or broken like ordinary objects. They also vanish if you
stop maintaining them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will by using your effect again (essentially
"re-creating" the object). Your created objects are stationary once you have created them, although other effects can
move them. Assume a created object has a volume rank equal to its mass rank. Create can't have Permanent duration, if
you want an object to own buy it as equipment.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you want to trap characters with objects instead use <a
href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>: Dazed, immobile, paralyzed.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-CREATED-OBJECTS-COVER-AND-CONCEALMENT">CREATED OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the object is opaque) just like a normal
object. Cover provided by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks outgoing attacks as well. Attacks
hitting the covering object damage it normally (see <b>Damaging Objects</b>). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a
created object provides just like any other cover (see <b>Indirect</b> modifier). The Selective modifier allows you to
vary the cover and concealment your objects provide. If you would like to create armor see <a
href="protection-defense.html">Protection</a> with descriptors instead.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DROPPING-OBJECTS">DROPPING OBJECTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Simply dropping a created object on a target is treated like a Cylinder Area Effect attack
based on the object's size (see <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a> extra) it is also shapeable due to the
nature of create. The object inflicts damage equal to its mass, and targets get a Dodge check to evade the falling
object, like normal area attacks.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">While a created object can potentially be wielded as an improvised weapon, the effect cannot
otherwise create attacks or other effects; you must acquire these effects separately (perhaps as Alternate Effects). Or
have an <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ACTIVATION">Activated</a> <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> with
descriptors.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-SUPPORTING-WEIGHT">SUPPORTING WEIGHT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If a created object needs to support weight--created as a bridge or to support a weakened
structure, for example--it has an effective Strength equal to its toughness rank. You can "shore up" a created object by
taking a standard action and concentrating, increasing its Strength by 1 for 1 round. You can
also use extra effort to increase a created object's Strength by 1 for 1 round, these modifiers are cumulative.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Food</b>: You can create food and drink. This would normally require transform with a
Chemistry (Int) skill check. You can't create anything that isn't edible such as poisonous or rotten food. It must be
considered food or drink by human standards: you can't use this to create hydrogen gas, for example, despite water being
contained in most foods. It tastes average by default. You should also have the modifier Innate Object for this power to
be meaningful (otherwise it can't satisfy hunger). The duration automatically ends if the food is eaten thus allowing
you to make another and eat again. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Impervious</b>: Applied to Create, this extra makes the objects' Toughness <a
href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-IMPERVIOUS">Impervious</a>. See the modifier for details. <b>Flat +2 points per
application.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Innate Object</b>: Create with this modifier makes objects that cannot be nullified as
ongoing effects, they're essentially "real" objects for all intents and purposes (although the user can "unmake" them at
will). They have all properties of that normal material including density and toughness instead of having toughness
equal to your effect rank. This means that you can't have the impervious or proportional modifiers for the objects.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Innate Power</b>: This is the standard innate modifier which means that the power to create
objects can't be Nullified. This is relatively useless since the object can still be Nullified as an ongoing effect thus
ending the duration. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Linked <a href="morph-general.html">Morph</a> (1 rank) Attack Affects Objects Only</b>: You
can control exactly what the object looks like. The colors may look like anything as long as it is not too detailed (for
that also add precise to this morph). <b>Flat +2 points.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Movable</b>: You can move your created objects around with a Move Object effect at your
Create rank (see <b>Move Object</b>). <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Precise</b>: You can create more precise and detailed objects. Generally intended for
smaller objects. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to any form of Crafting (Awe) check that is required for creating
detailed objects (not for crafting detailed objects after the raw material is created). <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Selective</b>: You can make your created objects selectively "transparent" to attacks,
blocking some while allowing others (yours and your allies', for example) to pass through them. You can also selectively
make your objects solid to some creatures and incorporeal to others, such as allowing one person to walk through a
created wall, while blocking another. It takes a free action to change the selective nature of an object; permanent
created objects cannot have their selectivity changed once they are created. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Subtle</b>: This modifier either makes created objects not noticeable as constructs for 1
rank (they look just like real objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects composed of invisible
force). <b>Flat +1or 2 points.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Tether</b>: You have a connection to your created objects, allowing you to exert your own
Strength to move them (provided you are strong enough to do so). <b>Flat 1 point.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Stationary</b>: Your created objects can hang immobile in the air. They resist being moved
with a Strength rank equal to the modifier rank. Unless you have the Tether extra or the Movable extra, you cannot move
a stationary created object once it's placed any more than anyone else can. <b>+0</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Feedback</b>: You may suffer damage when your created objects are damaged (see
<b>Feedback</b> flaw for details). <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Proportional</b>: Your created objects have a total volume rank plus Toughness rank equal to
your Create rank, rather than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you can create an object with volume rank 0
and Toughness equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in between, so long as the sum of the two ranks does
not exceed your Create rank and Toughness is a minimum of 0.
In this case the object's mass rank is equal to the object's Toughness so that it doesn't
collapse under its own weight. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
