<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</div>
<div class="right-panel red-panel">
<div>Under the Hood: Transform</div>
<div>
<div style="padding:5px">Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands of a cunning player. To a degree,
Transform can duplicate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by transforming air into a solid material or
turning oxygen into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). Due to the <a
href="index.html#TOC-EXCLUSIVE-PURPOSE">Rule of Exclusive Purpose</a> this is only allowed by use of a
<a href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">Power Stunt</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained duration, which may affect how such
"tricks" work (e.g., the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffocating gas dissipates unless the
character concentrates each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always, the GM should use common sense and good
judgment. Additionally being temporary means that while a character can Transform objects into gold
or jewels they will eventually change back. In order to acquire wealth buy the <a href="../../advantages.html#TOC-BENEFIT">
Benefit advantage</a>.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DESTRUCTIVE-TRANSFORMATIONS">DESTRUCTIVE TRANSFORMATIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects: turning a steel door into water,
air, or even rust certainly removes it as a barrier. However, keep in mind that Transform is normally sustained; the
target isn't truly destroyed. The destruction of targets tends to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of
wearing down and eventually destroying objects, use <a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a>Toughness instead.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-TRANSFORMING-BEINGS">TRANSFORMING BEINGS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can never transform an object to gain life. Transforming living or otherwise animate beings
as opposed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than Transform. To alter a target's outward appearance only, go
with a <a href="morph-general.html">Morph</a> Attack. For a harmful effect that does something like turn the target to
stone or into a mind-controlled zombie, see <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>, <a
href="mental-transform-attack.html">Mental Transform</a>, <a href="shrinking-general.html">Shrinking</a> etc. When
dealing with non-living creatures (those absent Stamina) capable of resistance checks (possessing Will)
a <a href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">power stunt</a> will allow Transform to be used
as <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>, <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a>, or <a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a> against them.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can change objects into other objects, altering their shape or material composition in the
process. You can only transform matter into matter, neither can be energy such as fire or electricity.
You can transform matter with a maximum mass and volume equal to your Transform rank-6. The resulting mass can't be
greater than the target mass. The targeted matter must have a toughness per inch (not total toughness) equal to or less
than your Transform rank-1.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When transforming an object the resulting matter will have the same mass.
The targeted object must be of any single material. The resulting object must be of the same material and
have the same state of matter (eg: solid, liquid) however you can control the appearance, color, and shape.
This will let you bend, break, destroy, or repair objects.
You can form any simple geometric shape or common object, such as: cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk, sand, pillow.
You may also do simple variations of the previous object shape such as: twisting into an arch, putting a hole large enough
to fit through, inserting tiny breathing holes, or shattering into small pieces.
The Gamemaster has final say on whether or not a particular object is too complex for this effect.
Generally, your objects can't have any moving parts more complex than a hinge.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Transform can't be permanent. When you stop maintaining it, the target
reverts to normal. The matter returns to exactly how it was before it was targeted which may cause
people to get stuck <a href="insubstantial-general.html#TOC-INSIDE-OBJECTS">inside of an object</a>.
Transform may <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">counter</a> another Transform by trying to change the same target.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Inanimate objects do not make resistance checks and Transform automatically.
Transforming someone's devices or equipment requires an attack.
The equipped character gets a +2 circumstance bonus to Dodge or Parry for hand-held and similar sized
objects. Targeting a worn suit of armor requires an attack check but
the wearer does not get a circumstance bonus for the large item.
Transform is generally just another way of "removing" a device or equipment, considered a part
of item's discount in cost, although the item will return once the effect ends.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Any form</b>: This extra requires Any material. The resulting object may be any state of matter
(including plasma), may be energy, or can simply not exist at all. If you choose for there to be no resulting object then
the current dimension temporarily has less mass. You may have the resulting object be something like electricity, fire,
light, or digital information although mind the volume limit and that <a href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> requires
a <a href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">power stunt</a>.
If the resulting object isn't matter then it can't be <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countered</a>
by another Transform. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Any material</b>: This extra requires Change state. The resulting object may be of any material
regardless of the target object's material. The resulting object must still be of a single material and has a maximum volume equal to
your Transform rank-6. The resulting object has a maximum total toughness (not per inch) equal to your Transform rank-1, the
<a href="../../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitation</a>,
or the material's natural total toughness whichever is lowest. The resulting object has a maximum mass equal to your Transform
rank-6, the target object's mass, or the material's natural total mass whichever is smallest. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Change state</b>: The resulting object may be either solid, liquid, or gas regardless of the
object's previous state of matter. The resulting object retains this state for the duration of the effect, for example
ice that doesn't melt or water that doesn't freeze. You may also allow the resulting object to change state naturally. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Edible</b>: If the resulting object is eaten then you can make the duration permanent. If you
don't make it permanent then the duration ends as normal and will cause the eater to be <a href="insubstantial-general.html#TOC-INSIDE-OBJECTS">
inside of an object</a>. <b>+1 flat point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Ignore complexity</b>: Your Transform ignores material and shape complexity. The target object
may be any combination of materials (if you have Any material extra) so long as the total mass and volume are within the limit and the highest toughness
is within the limit. You still can't create life however you can create a corpse. Creating a device or equipment requires
a <a href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">power stunt</a>. You aren't required to know how to form the
resulting objects but the request can't be too specific.
For example you can't say "the key to this door" or "a body that looks like the king's daughter" unless you know the required
key shape or the appearance of the princess. This extra includes both Precise and Selective which can't be included
in any other way. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
