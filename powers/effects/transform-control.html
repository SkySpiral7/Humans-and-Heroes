<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 2-5 points per rank</div>
<div class="generated-class-42">
<div class="generated-class-1">Under the Hood: Transform</div>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#F4CCCC">
<div style="padding:5px">Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands of a cunning player. To a degree,
Transform can duplicate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by transforming air into a solid material or
turning oxygen into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). Due to the <a
href="index.html#TOC-EXCLUSIVE-PURPOSE">Rule of Exclusive Purpose</a> this is only allowed by use of a <a
href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">Power Stunt</a> (see <a href="../../the-basics/index.html#TOC-POWER-STUNT">The
Basics</a> for details).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained duration, which may affect how such
"tricks" work (e.g., the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffocating gas dissipates unless the
character concentrates each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always, the GM should use common sense and good
judgment.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You may wish to require characters using Transform to acquire money (gold, precious gems, etc.)
or other permanent material goods to spend character points on ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain impermanent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter in your series
in some way.)</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DESTRUCTIVE-TRANSFORMATIONS">DESTRUCTIVE TRANSFORMATIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects: turning a steel door into water,
air, or even rust certainly removes it as a barrier. However, keep in mind that Transform is normally sustained; the
target isn't truly destroyed. The destruction of targets tends to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of
wearing down and eventually destroying objects, use <a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a>Toughness instead.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-TRANSFORMING-BEINGS">TRANSFORMING BEINGS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can never transform an object to gain life. Transforming living or otherwise animate beings
as opposed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than Transform. To alter a target's outward appearance only, go
with a <a href="morph-general.html">Morph</a> Attack. For a harmful effect that does something like turn the target to
stone or into a mind-controlled zombie, see <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>, <a
href="mental-transform-attack.html">Mental Transform</a>, <a href="shrinking-general.html">Shrinking</a> etc. When
dealing with non-living creatures (those absent Stamina) capable of resistance checks (possessing Will) the GM may
permit Transform to function like an <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>, <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> or <a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a> against them.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can change objects into other objects, altering their shape or material composition in the
process. You can only transform matter into matter, neither can be energy such as fire or electricity. You must touch
the chosen object, which requires a close attack check if the object is held or worn by another character.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">What you can transform affects cost per rank:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>2 points</b>: Transform one thing or substance into one other thing or substance, such as
metal into wood, iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>3 points</b>: Transform a broad group of things into a single result (any metal into gold,
for example) or a single target into any of a broad group (one type of metal, such as lead, into any other metal, water
into other liquids, and so forth).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>4 points</b>: Transform any object of one state of matter into another state of matter such
as solids into other solids or liquids into solids.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>5 points</b>: Transform any material into anything else.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Inanimate objects do not make resistance checks and transform automatically, so long as you can
affect their total mass and their material toughness is equal to or less than your transform rank x3. When determining
this material toughness use the toughness per inch instead of total toughness. Use the highest toughness if the object
has multiple materials. You can transform up to 1.5 lbs (mass rank -5), to increase this see the modifier Increased
Mass. For the first two types of transform it is possible to have a useless power if the only material you can transform
is too tough. The resulting material's toughness has no limitations except that it must be mundane. When transforming an
object the resulting matter will have the same mass unless it is transformed into nothing using the Destroy modifier
below. For simplicity material toughness is also material mass which means that unless you change the object's state of
matter transform is not effective at getting rid of objects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The transformation lasts as a sustained effect. When you stop maintaining it, the target
reverts to normal. Continuous Transform is irreversible except by using another Transform effect to turn the target back
into its previous form.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Transforming someone's devices or equipment requires targeting them first: characters can make
Dodge resistance checks for their held or worn items, with a +2 circumstance bonus for hand-held and similar sized
objects. So transforming a hand-held weapon like a gun requires an attack check and permits the wielder a Dodge
resistance check with a +2 bonus (for a hand-held item). Targeting a worn suit of armor requires an attack check and
allows the wearer a Dodge resistance check (with no modifier for a large item).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Transform is generally just another way of "removing" a device or equipment, considered a part
of their discount in cost, although transformed items should eventually be restored or replaced.
Transform can't be permanent.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Destroy</b>: Instead of transforming the object into something else, you destroy the matter
entirely. You must first have a transform base of 5 since this changes the state of matter (sorta) making the minimum
total points per rank 6. Such destruction can't be repaired but will still be reversed when duration ends. A body must
exist before revival is possible. Note that this is the only kind of bodily destruction that <b>Immortality</b> and
<b>Healing</b> can't repair from if there the entire body is destroyed (<b>Regeneration</b> also won't work since only
living subjects can regenerate). <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Food</b>: You can transform objects into food and drink. This would normally require a
Chemistry (Int) skill check. You can't transform it into anything that isn't edible such as poisonous or rotten food. It
must be considered food or drink by human standards: you can't use this to create hydrogen gas, for example, despite
water being contained in most foods. It tastes average by default. The duration automatically ends if the food is eaten
thus allowing you to transform another and eat again. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Precise</b>: You can transform objects into more precise and detailed objects. You can
change the resulting object's color. You also get a +2 circumstance bonus to any form of Crafting (Awe) check that is
required for transforming into detailed objects (not for crafting detailed objects from raw material). <b>Flat +1
point.</b></div>
