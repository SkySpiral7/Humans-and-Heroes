<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 6 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can temporarily increase your size, gaining various bonuses such as Strength and Stamina
while becoming a bigger and heavier at the cost of various penalties such as less agile target, unable to maneuver
through small spaces. <b>Growth</b> modifiers are restricted by power level limits.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Each rank of <b>Growth</b> doubles your size (increase size by 1 rank). Ordinary humans start out at
size rank -2 (between 3 and 6 feet tall). You also get +1 base speed, +1 Strength, +1 Stamina, and +1 mass. These bonuses
are known as absolute size bonuses but you are also affected by Relative size penalties and bonuses. If you lack Stamina
instead get +1 Fortitude and +1 Toughness.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that <b>Growth</b> and <a href="shrinking-general.html">Shrinking</a> in size must be bodily
proportional meaning if your head grows in size by 3 ranks so must the rest of your body. In order to assume forms of
other proportions see <a href="morph-general.html">Morph</a>.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b><a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-LINKED">Linked</a> <a href="morph-general.html">Morph</a>
</b>: By <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-LINKED">linking</a> to <a href="morph-general.html">Morph</a> (1 rank)
<b>Growth</b> and <a href="shrinking-general.html">Shrinking</a> no longer need to be bodily proportional as long as mass, size
(height), and volume are correct. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Opposite Duration</b>: Instead of using the power to become abnormal sized you use it to
become normal sized. Your default size is not rank -2 (6 ft). For example Opposite Duration <b>Growth</b> 2 would mean your
innate size is rank 0 and you activate <b>Growth</b> to become size -2 so that if countered or during power loss you return to
the size rank 0. This exists as a much cheaper version of Permanent Innate Shrinking with <b>Growth</b>. A power with this
modifier can't increase ranks since that would change your character's default size. <b>Growth</b> with this modifier can't
also have permanent duration since that defeats the purpose. <b>+1 cost per rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Unmovable</b>: Instead of gaining mass you only gain the inertia of increased mass. So that
you are as hard to move or trip as if you were heavy but without damaging any floor you stand on (rather your weight is
unchanged by using the power). <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Remove Absolute Size Bonus</b>: You retain either your Size, Strength, Stamina, or Mass
while using this power. Choose only one of those traits per application but you can't have four applications to choose
them all since then the power would do nothing. Note that you can't choose base speed since that is determined by
absolute size. <b>-1 cost per rank per application.</b></div>
