<p>This page contains additional examples of characters, powers, and devices. Some of the examples are based on
material I don't own and it will be labeled where it is from.</p>
<p>Note that there are plenty of characters who have already been converted into M&amp;M 3e the most popular/biggest one
is <a href="http://www.atomicthinktank.com/viewforum.php?f=14">The Atomic Think Tank Forum: Roll Call</a> but there's also
<a href="http://mmconversions.wikidot.com/">Mutants &amp; Masterminds Conversions wikidot</a>. Note that people
tend to fall victim to the snafu of meaningless numbers and make the character PL 10. Even if you picked a strength for
Superman (DC comics) to be consistent with, that number shouldn't be anywhere near PL 10.</p>
<p><b>Magic Conch Shell</b>: Sample device from SpongeBob SquarePants "Club SpongeBob" s3e2a/e42a.
Attain any Knowledge (5),
Easily Removable: -1 points,
Misinformation: half the time it tells you to do nothing (granted the plot had it always works out in their favor),
Quirk: must be a club member to use it -0 flat point (since joining the club has virtually no requirements). Total: 3 points.

<p>Below is a list of full character sheets. The links simply go to an Xml file which can be loaded into the
<a href="secret-origins/point-counter.html">point counter</a>. Currently you have to save the Xml
file and then either upload it or open and copy: sorry for the lack of better way.</p>
