<div class="page-header-red">SUPPLEMENTARY RULES</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<p>This page contains additional details and extra rules. Basically it contains anything that I started to ramble off
topic about. The order they are listed is small ones alphabetically then the large ones alphabetically.</p>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Absent Abilities Exceptions Examples</b>: A poltergeist is able to manipulate physical
objects without having a physical form and thus has Dexterity without Fighting. For a ghost to be able to use close
combat having strength and fighting see Innate <b>Insubstantial</b> and <b>Affects Corporeal</b>. Some plants have
exceptions including: a Venus Fly Trap has Fighting (in order to trap bugs), a sunflower can sense the direction of the
sun despite having no awareness, some plants gain or lose their leaves based on some kind of input, and plants can
slowly move closer to sources of water (sense and agility) at the rate of like 1 inch a year.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Catching</b>: Catching a falling person or object requires a Dexterity check (DC -1). If you
successfully catch a falling object, subtract your Strength rank from the falling damage rank. Both you and the object
suffer any remaining damage. So if a character with Strength 5 catches someone falling for 12 damage, subtract 5 from
12, and both characters resist damage 7. If the catcher is using a power--such as <b>Flight</b> or <b>Move
Object</b>--to catch the falling object, the power's rank can be substituted for Strength at the GM's discretion.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Lasting Injuries</b>: If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game,
or just in a particular story, they are better handled as complications (see the <b>Complications</b> section in <a
href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a> for details). This is largely how the comics handle them; most of the time, heroes
bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and significant injury--such as
a broken arm or head trauma--that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other GM-imposed
complication: award the player a victory point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication to the
story. Use the conditions defined in <a href="the-basics/index.html">The Basics</a> as an idea of the complications facing an
injured character.</div>
