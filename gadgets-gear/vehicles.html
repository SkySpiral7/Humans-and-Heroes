<h1>VEHICLES</h1>
<p>Not every hero can fly (or teleport, or run at super-speed...). Sometimes heroes make use of
other means to get around. Vehicles are used primarily for transportation, although they may come with additional
capabilities--including weapons--making them useful in other situations as well.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-VEHICLE-TRAITS">VEHICLE TRAITS</h2>
<p>Vehicles have the following traits: Size, Strength, Speed, Defense, and Toughness. Like
characters, each of a vehicle's traits costs points to improve. The basic cost for a vehicle is its Speed, but other
things, like the vehicle's ability to haul cargo or resist damage, cost points as well. Vehicles can even have power
effects of their own. Equipment point costs are summarized on <b>Table: Vehicle Trait Costs</b>.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-SIZE">SIZE</h3>
<p>A vehicle's size is measured in categories, as shown on <b>Table: Vehicle Size Categories</b>.
A vehicle's size determines its base Strength, Toughness, and Defense values. Vehicles start out at medium size by
default, and each increase in size category costs 5 equipment points.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STRENGTH">STRENGTH</h3>
<p>A vehicle's Strength, much like a character's, determines its carrying capacity. You can
increase a vehicle's Strength over the base rank for its size for 1 equipment point per Strength rank.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SPEED">SPEED</h3>
<p>A vehicle buys the appropriate movement effect(s) for its Speed, paying the normal cost.
Vehicles with multiple modes of movement (air, ground, and water, for example) pay full cost for the most expensive and
can acquire the others as Alternate Effects (see <b>Alternate Effect</b> modifier in <a href="../powers/index.html">Powers</a>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEFENSE">DEFENSE</h3>
<p>A vehicle's size determines its base Defense, which is used to determine the Defense Class to
hit the vehicle with attacks. For sizes larger than medium, this is a penalty, making it easier to target the vehicle,
even to the point where attackers can hit it as a routine check. You can "buy off" the Defense penalty applied to a
vehicle for 1 equipment point per -1 penalty removed. A vehicle's active defenses (Dodge since a vehicle doesn't
normally have Parry) are equal to the pilot's skill ranks in piloting with a maximum rank equal to the vehicle's Defense
rank which in this case represents maneuverability.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TOUGHNESS">TOUGHNESS</h3>
<p>Size category determines a vehicle's base Toughness rank, used for Toughness resistance checks.
You can increase a vehicle's Toughness over the base rank for its size for 1 equipment point per Toughness rank.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FEATURES">FEATURES</h3>
<p>Certain things are considered "standard" on any vehicle. These include seating, safety
harnesses or seat belts, heating and air-conditioning, radio receiver, headlights, and similar things with little or no
impact on game play. Features are "optional extras" for vehicles and cost 1 point each. The GM can determine if other
features are included in the vehicle or cost points. Some "features" are actually powers, described in the following
section.</p>
<p><b>Alarm</b>: The vehicle has an alarm system that goes off when an unauthorized access or
activation attempt is made. A Technology check (DC 10) can overcome the alarm. For each additional equipment point, the
DC increases by 2 to a maximum of DC 20.</p>
<p><b>Autopilot</b>: You get a built in computer that can make any kind of piloting decisions and
can improvise to the same degree as any person could. This acts like a minion with a pilot skill rank of 10 and a
navigation rank of 1 except it always makes routine checks (rolls an effective 0 on the dice) on any checks and it
doesn't know the location of anything unless it has a GPS or map (see <b>Navigation System</b> and <b>GPS</b> below).
For more advanced piloting buy a minion or sidekick (whether a computer construct or otherwise).</p>
<p><b>Caltrops</b>: A vehicle may be equipped with a dispenser for caltrops, spikes meant to
damage tired. Activating the dispenser is a standard action. Caltrops automatically blow out the tires of ordinary
vehicles that run over them (consider such vehicles minions in that they automatically fail by two degrees).
Heroes and villains can make DC 3 Toughness checks for
their vehicles; tires are Toughness 3. One degree of failure slows the vehicle, while two degrees of failure immobilize
it.</p>
<p><b>GPS</b>: see <a href="index.html#TOC-SURVIVAL-GEAR">Gadgets and Gear</a> for description but it costs 6 equipment points
total (5 points if you are replacing the navigation system below).</p>
<p><b>Hidden Compartments</b>: The vehicle has hidden compartments or cargo areas holding up to a
tenth of the vehicle's medium load in cargo. A Perception check (DC 10) allows the searcher to find the hidden
compartment. For each additional equipment point, the DC increases by 2 to a maximum of DC 30.</p>
<p><b>Navigation System</b>: The vehicle is equipped with a navigation system that grants a +2
circumstance bonus on skill checks related to navigation. The instruments included are such things like a map and
compass. This is built in to a GPS (see above) so that you could remove this before getting a GPS.</p>
<p><b>Oil Slick</b>: The vehicle can release an oil slick, covering a 20-ft. by 20-ft. area and
forcing the driver of a pursuing vehicle to make a Vehicles check (DC 5) to retain control of the vehicle. Releasing
the oil slick is a standard action.</p>
<p><b>Remote Control</b>: The vehicle's owner can operate it remotely using a transmitter and
control device. remotely controlling a vehicle requires the same kind of action (usually a move action) as if you were
actually behind the wheel of the vehicle.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWERS">POWERS</h3>
<p>A vehicle can have power effects of its own, usually reflecting the vehicle's systems. Attack
effects are suitable for vehicle-mounted weapons, while defense effects protect the vehicle (and often the passengers)
from harm. Vehicle powers have their normal cost for the vehicle (meaning they cost one-fifth the normal amount for the
vehicle's owner, since the effects are incorporated into the vehicle and cost equipment points rather than Character
points).</p>
<p><b>Armor</b>: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addition to its normal Toughness,
possibly including Impervious Protection. Some vehicles may have Sustained Protection (such as force screens) instead
of, or in addition to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.</p>
<p><b>Cloaking Device</b>: A vehicle may have a "cloaking device" granting Concealment from visual
senses. Some vehicles may also have Concealment from auditory senses or things such as radar, giving them a "stealth
mode." 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense type) or 8 points (all visual senses).</p>
<p><b>Immunity</b>: Vehicles normally provide immunity to the normal hazards of environments they
travel through--such as underwater or in space--at no additional cost. Additional Immunity effects are for unusual
hazards or circumstances, such as a car that provides a sealed air system, granting immunity to suffocation and other
atmospheric hazards.</p>
<p><b>Smokescreen</b>: The vehicle can release a cloud of thick smoke or mist that provides an
Area visual Concealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pursuers. 12 points.</p>
<p><b>Weapons</b>: Vehicle weapons are based on various attack effects, particularly Damage with
various modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may mount versions of some of the weapons listed
elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SHARED-VEHICLES">SHARED VEHICLES</h3>
<p>A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole team, particularly useful for shuttling
around team members who cannot fly or move at super-speed. The members of the team divide the equipment point cost of
the vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the necessary ranks of the Equipment advantage to covering the
vehicle's cost.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-GROUND-VEHICLES">GROUND VEHICLES</h2>
<p>Most cars include such standard features as air conditioning, air bags, antilock brakes, cruise
control, keyless entry, and an AM/FM radio with CD player. Luxury vehicles often also include extras such as power
seats, leather upholstery, and a sunroof.</p>
<p><b>Cars</b> come in many different varieties. For variations on the base model, add +1 or +2
Str for larger, full-sized, cars, and +1 or even +2 Speed for sports and racing cars.</p>
<p><b>Trucks</b> include pick-ups, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans, and similarly sized
vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Tanks</b> are heavily armed and armored vehicles. The standard tank has Impervious Toughness
12 and comes equipped with a cannon (Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area 6) and a heavy machine gun (Ranged Multiattack Damage
6). It takes a move action to get into or out of a tank, and another move action to start it up.</p>
<p><b>APCs</b> or Armored Personnel Carriers, are designed for carrying troops. They come with a
smaller cannon (Ranged Damage 6, Burst Area 4), Impervious Toughness 8, and are set up so soldiers on board can fire
their personal weapons from behind the cover of the APC's armor.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-WATER-VEHICLES">WATER VEHICLES</h2>
<p>Water vehicles range from small boats and outboards to massive sea-going ships.</p>
<p><b>Cutters</b> are used by the Coast Guard and the Navy. They're often equipped with light
machine guns (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6).</p>
<p><b>Destroyers</b> are main naval ships, carrying heavy guns (Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area
8).</p>
<p><b>Battleships</b> have massive gun batteries (Ranged Damage 13, Burst Area 9) and heavy
armor.</p>
<p><b>Submarines</b> are equipped with torpedoes (Ranged damage 8, Burst Area 5) and often
ballistic missiles (Ranged Burst Area Damage 15 or higher, not included in listed cost).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AIR-VEHICLES">AIR VEHICLES</h2>
<p>Air vehicles are all capable of flight, some of them at very high speeds.</p>
<p><b>Military helicopters</b> are equipped with machine guns (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6) and
rockets (Ranged Damage 9, Burst Area 6).</p>
<p><b>Fighter jets</b> have machine guns (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6) and air-to-air missiles
(Ranged Damage 11, Burst Area 8, Homing 6).</p>
<p><b>Bombers</b> may have machine guns and missiles, but also have powerful bombs (Burst Area
Damage 12 or higher) they can drop on targets.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SPACE-VEHICLES">SPACE VEHICLES</h2>
<p>Space vehicles are intended for use outside the atmosphere, some of them for interplanetary or
even interstellar travel. Generally space vehicles are found in the possession of alien civilizations, although the GM
may choose to allow some organizations and individuals on Earth to have space vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Space fighters</b> are armed with blaster cannons (Ranged Damage 10).</p>
<p><b>Space cruisers</b> have larger beam weapons (Ranged damage 12) and often energy torpedoes
(Ranged Damage 12, Burst Area 10, Homing 8).</p>
<p><b>Space battleships</b> have the most massive weapons: blaster cannons (Ranged Damage 15) and
high-powered energy torpedoes (Ranged Damage 15, Burst Area 12, Homing 8).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SPECIAL-VEHICLES">SPECIAL VEHICLES</h2>
<p>These are unique vehicles, most likely found in the possession of supervillains, aliens, or
eccentric inventors.</p>
<p><b>Dimension hopper</b> is a vansized vehicle capable of moving between dimensions like a rank
3 Movement (Dimensional Travel) effect.</p>
<p><b>Mole-machines</b> are classic weapons for underground villains, consisting of a metallic
cylinder with treads and a rotating drill mounted on the front, allowing the machine to bore through the earth. Its
speed is a <b>Burrowing effect</b>.</p>
<p><b>Time machines</b> may be enclosed vehicles, from cubes to spheres or even pods on legs or
police boxes, or they can simply be open platforms or projectors. They provide a Movement (Time Travel) effect,
typically rank 2 or 3, although some time machines may transmit only to a fixed point in time.</p>
