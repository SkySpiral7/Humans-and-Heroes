<div style="padding:5px">Whether it's an underground cave, the top floors of a skyscraper, a satellite in orbit, or a
base on the Moon, many heroes and villains maintain their own secret (or not so secret) headquarters. Teams may even
pool their equipment points to have a headquarters they share, with the Gamemaster's approval. The GM may even provide a
certain number of free equipment points to the team to spend on a headquarters.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A character can even have multiple bases of operation (see <b>Alternate Headquarters</b> later
in this section). This is more common for villains, who have back-up plans and secret bases they can retreat to when
their plans are defeated. If a character's headquarters is destroyed, the character can choose to rebuild it or build a
new headquarters with different features using the same equipment points. Supervillains often go through a succession of
different lairs.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-HEADQUARTERS-TRAITS">HEADQUARTERS TRAITS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Headquarters have two main traits--Size and Toughness--and a number of possible Features. Each
of these costs equipment points.</div>

<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SIZE">SIZE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A structure's size is measured similarly to that of a vehicle, and gives a general idea of the
overall space it occupies and how much space is available inside it. See <b>Table: Structure Size Categories</b> for
guidelines. A headquarters starts out at Small size for 0 points. Each increase in size category costs 1 point, each
decrease in size category gives you an additional point to spend elsewhere on your headquarters, although you're not
going to have a lot of room for extras!</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-TOUGHNESS">TOUGHNESS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A headquarters' Toughness indicates the strength of its structural materials, particularly its
outer structure (walls, ceiling, etc.). A structure starts out with Toughness 6 for 0 points. +2 Toughness costs 1
equipment point.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL">POWER LEVEL</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Some features refer to a headquarters' power level. For player characters, this is the power
level of the series overall. For non-player characters, particularly villains, this is the base-owner's effective power
level, or whatever power level the GM wishes to set, using the series power level as a guideline.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FEATURES">FEATURES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A headquarters may have a number of features, chosen from the list below. A headquarters
automatically has the basic structural amenities like doors and windows, power outlets, utilities, and so forth at no
cost. Each feature costs 1 equipment point. You can invent additional features, basing them off the ones given here,
with the permission of the Gamemaster.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-COMBAT-SIMULATOR">COMBAT SIMULATOR</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A combat simulator is a special room equipped with various devices intended to test characters'
powers and skills and allow them to train in realistic combat situations. Generally, a combat simulator has a suite of
equipment that can simulate any appropriate attack effect at a rank up to the HQ power level. As an additional feature,
the combat simulator can project realistic illusions, allowing it to recreate or simulate almost any environment. Combat
simulators are useful for training and short "war games" (pitting the characters against each other or simulated
opponents). Clever heroes also can try to lure intruders into the combat simulator or an intruder might override the
simulator's control systems and trap the heroes in it, turning it into a deathtrap.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-COMMUNICATIONS">COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The communications feature allows the headquarters to receive and transmit on a wide range of
radio and TV bands, monitor police and emergency channels, coordinate communications between members of a team, and so
forth. It includes communications equipment, consoles, and monitors. The system's access to restricted communication
bands depends on the clearance and skills of the user. Heroes often have access to special government channels, while a
successful Technology skill check (DC 15) can grant a user illegal access to restricted systems.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-COMPUTER">COMPUTER</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A state-of-the-art computer system serves the entire headquarters. This allows characters to
make full use of the Technology skill and the computer can be programmed to handle routine base functions (including
monitoring communications channels and controlling defensive systems). An artificially intelligent computer system
should be created as a Minion or Sidekick, perhaps with the cost shared among members of a team. See <b>Constructs</b>
for more.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-CONCEALED">CONCEALED</h3>
<div style="float:right;width:400px;margin:20px 0px 20px 20px">
<a href="http://stornart.com/images/artfiles/QBldgLoRes.html">
<img height="258" src="../images/building.jpg" width="400" /></a>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The headquarters is a secret and is hidden from the outside world in some way. It may be camouflaged behind a
false facade, buried underground, or even hiding in plain sight (ie its existence as a headquarters is unknown).
So, for example, people assume the abandoned house on the hill or the old, closed-down factory are just that.
Note this is in addition to the Isolated feature, if any. An
isolated headquarters is difficult to reach, while a concealed headquarters is difficult to find in the first place.
Skill checks to locate the headquarters have their DC increased by +2 per application of this feature, to a maximum of +20
(for truly "top-secret" locations).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DEFENSE-SYSTEM">DEFENSE SYSTEM</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A defense system consists of various weapon emplacements defending the exterior and interior of
the headquarters. A defense system can have any attack effect with a cost no greater than twice the HQ power level.
Their attack bonus is equal to the power level. DEATHTRAPS</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A villainous version of the Defense System feature is deathtraps: the villain's lair has one or
more fiendish traps suitable for disposing of those pesky heroes. Some death-traps are designed as security systems to
keep heroes out: concealed auto-guns, walls of flames, sealing rooms that fill with water or sand, and so forth. Others
are intended for the slow elimination of captured heroes.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that not having this feature does not mean a villain cannot jury-rig a deathtrap within
the lair--say, by chaining heroes beneath a rocket counting down to launch, or slowly lowering them into a volcano's
caldera. It just means there's no part of the base specifically designed as a deathtrap.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Also note that, in spite of the name, not all "deathtraps" are necessarily lethal. Some may be
intended to merely incapacitate and capture intruders (more along the lines of a non-lethal Defense System), allowing the
villain to interrogate them...and then perhaps put them into a real deathtrap!</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DIMENSIONAL-PORTAL">DIMENSIONAL PORTAL</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The headquarters has a portal or gateway to another dimension or dimensions. This can range
from an otherwise innocuous-looking door to a humming high-tech portal surrounded by support equipment and monitors. The
portal provides two-way travel to and from the other dimension, and it may even reach a number of related dimensions. At
the GM's discretion, an appropriate skill check--typically Expertise or Technology--may be required to operate the
portal.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DOCK">DOCK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A dock houses water vehicles and includes access to a nearby waterway, an airlock or lock
system for moving vehicles in and out of the dock, and dry-dock facilities for repairing and maintaining water vehicles.
The headquarters should be located within reasonable distance of a body of water to have this feature.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DUAL-SIZE">DUAL SIZE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The headquarters has two separate Size categories: its inside category (purchased normally),
which determines the structure's interior space, and an outside category, one or more size categories smaller. In
essence, the headquarters is larger on the inside than on the outside! So a small house, for example, might contain the
space of a huge castle on the inside. The GM may even allow size categories beyond Awesome, with each additional
category doubling size; expensive HQs could be pocket universes! Pay the cost of the larger size, plus this feature,
which lets you set the exterior size at any smaller category.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">In general, the exterior dimensions of the HQ cannot be smaller than a miniscule structure,
about the size of a closet or phone booth (or, say, a wardrobe or police box), large enough for an adult human to pass
through whatever serves as the base's entrance. Headquarters that have no "exterior" structure, such as an
extra-dimensional fortress accessed by a magical talisman, do not have this feature, but instead have things like
Dimensional Portal, Isolated, Sealed, and the like.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-EFFECT">EFFECT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A headquarters can be given any appropriate power effect as a feature with the Gamemaster's
approval. The effect cannot have a total cost greater than twice the HQ power level and cannot exceed the power level
limits. Effects are assumed to affect either the headquarters or its occupants, if they do both, apply the Affects
Others modifier, or take them as separate features.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-FIRE-PREVENTION-SYSTEM">FIRE PREVENTION SYSTEM</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The headquarters is equipped with an automatic system for detecting and extinguishing fires.
Any large open flame sets the system off (beware, fire-using heroes!). It functions as a Nullify Fire 5 effect. A
computer-controlled fire prevention system can be programmed to ignore certain sources of fire or the system can be
placed on manual control (requiring someone to throw a switch in order to activate it).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-GARAGE">GARAGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A garage houses ground vehicles and includes a ramp, elevator, or other access to move vehicles
in and out, facilities for repairing and maintaining vehicles, and a sliding access door.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-GROUNDS">GROUNDS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">In addition to the actual building(s) of the headquarters, it has a considerable area of land
surrounding it. An HQ can have surrounding land of one size category larger than the structure at no cost, without
having this feature. Having it allows for grounds up to three size categories larger than the structure, so a large
mansion headquarters could have a colossal area of land.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If the headquarters has features like Defense System and Security System, they also extend over
the grounds (with fences, sensors, weapon emplacements, and so forth).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-GYM">GYM</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A gym consists of weight-training and other exercise machines, space for working out,
stretching, and similar exercises, and all the necessary amenities (lockers, showers, etc.). Some HQs may incorporate
the gym feature into the combat simulator, for a multi-purpose training room. A gym may also include a pool (heated or
unheated, good for aquatic characters), possibly even connected to an outside body of water, to the base's dock, or both
at no additional cost.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-HANGAR">HANGAR</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A hangar houses air and space vehicles. It includes a hatch and/or runway for the vehicles to
launch and facilities for repairing and maintaining flying vehicles. For some HQs the launch facilities of the hangar
may require a long tunnel or other access to the outside.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-HOLDING-CELLS">HOLDING CELLS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">These are cells for holding prisoners, usually temporarily, although some headquarters might
have more permanent holding facilities. The cells are equipped with Nullify devices (ranked at the HQ power level) or
their basic Toughness is increased by 50%, which option should be agreed upon by both player and GM (both options for
two features). Heroes use holding cells to contain captured villains until they can be turned over to the proper
authorities while villains use them to keep heroes prisoner until they can dispose of them in their latest
death-trap.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-INFIRMARY">INFIRMARY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An infirmary consists of hospital beds and equipment for the full use of the Treatment skill.
An infirmary can provide treatment for a number of characters equal to the base's power level at one time and it can be
assumed to have the necessary facilities to handle any unusual physiology of the base's owner(s).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-ISOLATED">ISOLATED</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Headquarters with this feature are situated somewhere out of the way like the Antarctic, the
bottom of the ocean, on top of a lonely mountain peak, even in orbit or on the Moon. The base's owner doesn't have to
worry about things like door-to-door salesmen or other unwanted visitors but the headquarters is also far from
civilization (which can be limiting for heroes unable to travel fast). The headquarters is assumed to provide all the
necessary life-support for its location, but doesn't provide characters with the means to get to the base or travel
back. They need the appropriate powers, a vehicle, or a separate base feature.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-LABORATORY">LABORATORY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A laboratory is a facility for performing scientific tests or experiments. It contains all the
necessary scientific equipment, including dedicated computers, if the headquarters doesn't have its own computer system.
Characters can use the laboratory to perform research, study unusual phenomena (including many super-powers), and so
forth. A laboratory may be required for certain Expertise, Investigation, or Technology skill checks, or provide a
circumstance bonus to those checks.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-LIBRARY">LIBRARY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A library allows for use of various Knowledge skills when doing research. A library may consist
of printed matter (books and periodicals), microfilm, digital files, or a combination of all three. A library may
facilitate certain Expertise skill checks and provide a circumstance bonus for them.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-LIVING-SPACE">LIVING SPACE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The headquarters includes all the necessary amenities for people to live there full-time. This
is usually a number of residents equal to the HQ's power level comfortably (possibly more, at the GM's discretion). It
includes bedrooms or private suites, kitchen facilities, dining area, and common living areas. Characters can live in a
headquarters lacking this feature short-term, but they're not likely to be very comfortable.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-PERSONNEL">PERSONNEL</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The HQ has a staff of personnel commensurate with its size and facilities. The personnel cannot
live on site unless you also buy the Living Space feature. The staff is made up of characters created and controlled by
the GM and tasked with servicing does. If this feature is taken twice, the structure will even rebuild itself in a week
if it is destroyed! If it cannot rebuild in its original location, it reappears in the nearest suitable place.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A base's personnel may help defend it in case of attack, but they're not going to go out on
missions or otherwise assist outside of their duties. This feature simply ensures there's someone taking care of the
place while the owner isn't at home.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that an HQ's personnel do not have to be ordinary humans. They could be service robots,
magical golems, animated skeletons, enslaved aliens, trained apes, or just about anything else the GM chooses to fit
with the theme of the base and its owner(s).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-POWER-SYSTEM">POWER SYSTEM</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A power system makes the headquarters completely independent of outside power. It has its own
generators (which may be solar, geothermal, nuclear, cosmic, or anything else the designer wants). They provide the
base's entire power needs. The headquarters also has emergency back-up power should the generators fail. This generally
lasts for a number of hours equal to the HQ's power level.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-SEALED">SEALED</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This is similar to the Isolated feature, except the lair is sealed off from the outside world
rather than isolated by geographic location. It may be a structure with no doors, windows, or other outside access, or
behind some sort of barrier. Only the lair's owner and designated guests may enter, although the GM should determine
means by which trespassers might do so, including effects like Dimensional Travel, Insubstantial, Permeate, and
Teleport.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-SECURITY-SYSTEM">SECURITY SYSTEM</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Various locks and alarms protect the headquarters from unauthorized access. A Technology check
(DC 10) overcomes these systems. Each additional feature increases the DC by +2, to a maximum of DC 30. The security
system may be tied into a defense system (if the headquarters is equipped with that feature), so triggering an alarm
activates the defense system to disable or restrain the intruder(s).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-SELF-REPAIRING">SELF-REPAIRING</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The structure of the headquarters "heals" any damage done to it over time. Essentially, it
recovers like a character</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-TEMPORAL-LIMBO">TEMPORAL LIMBO</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Time within the headquarters actually moves at a different rate than that of the world outside!
Time within the structure is either slowed or sped up compared to the normal passage of time, passing at half or twice
the normal rate. Each additional application of this feature doubles the ratio of time passage: one-quarter or four
times, one-eighth or eight times, and so forth.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This time differential allows a character within an accelerated Temporal Limbo to spend
additional time planning, building, or recovering while little or no time passes outside, for example. Conversely, it
allows characters in a slowed Temporal Limbo to pass great amounts of time outside without aging, perhaps allowing for
long periods of self-imposed exile or contemplation.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-WORKSHOP">WORKSHOP</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A workshop has all the facilities for making various things. It includes tools, workbenches,
supplies, and so forth. The Gamemaster may rule certain projects require a dedicated workshop of their own (which is an
additional feature). For example, a workshop can easily handle woodworking, metalworking, and machining, but might not
be suitable for creating magical inventions (see <b>Inventing</b>), which require a separate dedicated workshop.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SHARED-HEADQUARTERS">SHARED HEADQUARTERS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A team of heroes most often has a headquarters they all share. In this case, the team members
may divide up the equipment point cost of the HQ among them however they wish, usually as evenly as possible. Given the
equipment point costs of most HQs, team members rarely have to devote more than a single rank of the Equipment advantage
to their headquarters, and any excess points may also cover things like team vehicles and equipment (commlinks, for
example).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ALTERNATE-HEADQUARTERS">ALTERNATE HEADQUARTERS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">In the event that a character has more than one headquarters, such as hidden bases scattered
around the world, the others are treated as Alternate Equipment: the character pays the points for the most expensive
HQ, then 1 equipment point for each additional HQ of the same or lesser cost. The extra headquarters are largely a
convenience (for heroes visiting other areas) and insurance against the loss of any one HQ.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The only exception to the Alternate Headquarters guideline is a shared headquarters
(previously), the characters sharing the HQ all contribute to its cost and pay for any personal headquarters separately.
As such, they shouldn't be considered all-purpose Minions of the occupant(s).</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-SAMPLE-HEADQUARTERS">SAMPLE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Gamemasters can use the following sample headquarters as ready-made lairs for supervillains
while players can use them as bases for their heroes.</div>
