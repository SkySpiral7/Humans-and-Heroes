<div style="font-size:16px">
<p>Heroes sneak into the closely guarded lairs of criminal masterminds, infiltrate alien computer systems, and build
devices beyond the understanding of modern science. They can piece together obscure clues to a villain's latest plot,
run along tightropes, and pilot vehicles through obstacle courses, all in a day's work. In this game they do so through
the use of various <b>skills</b>.</p>
<div style="border-style:solid thin rgb(11,83,148);font-size:26px;font-weight:bolder;background-color:rgb(11,83,148);padding:5px;margin:30px 0px;color:rgb(255,255,255);border-radius:10px;clear:both">SKILL BASICS</div>
<p>Skills are learned abilities, a combination of training (the skill) and natural talent (an ability rank). Each skill
has a rank, used as a bonus to the dice roll when using the skill. To make a skill check, roll:</p>
<div style="padding:5px;text-align:center;font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:rgb(153,0,0)">3dF + skill rank + ability modifier - distance penalty + miscellaneous modifiers</div>
<p>The total value before rolling is limited by power level limitations (power level +10) even if multiple skills were
used. The Gamemaster may allow circumstance bonuses to be excluded from this limitation at his discretion. For details
on each part see the sections below.</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A power level 10 character with Swimming (Str) 18 and Athletics (Str) 1 and a Strength of 5 wants to swim. Athletics is a -2 away from swimming so add them up as follows: max(Swimming-distance, 0)+max(Athletics-distance, 0)+Strength = 18+0+5 = 23 but this is too high for his power level limitations so instead he gets only a +20 to his roll. Notice that he didn't receive a penalty from having Athletics.</div>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-SKILL-RANK"></a>SKILL RANK</h3>
<p>Your rank in a skill, based on the points you have invested in that skill. If you have ranks in a skill you're
considered <b>trained</b> in that skill. You can use some skills even if you don't have any ranks in them, known as
using a skill <b>untrained</b>. Some skills may not be used untrained.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-ABILITY-MODIFIER"></a>ABILITY MODIFIER</h3>
<p>Each skill has an <b>ability modifier</b> applied to the skill's checks. Each skill's ability modifier is noted in
its description and on <b>Table:&nbsp;Skills</b>. If you use a skill untrained, the ability modifier still applies to
the skill check.</p>
<p>The ability listed in the skill description is only for generalized use and may change based on the situation. For
example Athletics (Str) can be used for Climbing (Str), Sprinting (Agl), or Long Distance Running (Sta).</p>
<p>Mental based skills like Knowledge checks might change the mental ability used but can't use physical abilities. Any
of the application skills (anything that doesn't use Int) can be used as a Knowledge skill with an Int ability to answer
some questions about whatever skill it is. For example Swimming (Str) can be used as Knowledge: Swimming (Int) to answer
the question "what is a butterfly stroke?" but on the otherhand Knowledge: Swimming (Int) can't be used as Swimming
(Str) although a successful Knowledge check might give a circumstance bonus due to knowing how to do such as stroke. For
another example Knowledge: Investigation can represent experience in the field and thus a successful roll can explain
where the best places to start looking for evidence providing a +2 bonus to the following Gather Evidence check.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-DISTANCE-PENALTY"></a>DISTANCE PENALTY</h3>
<p>Due to an unlimited number of skills existing there is the ability to use related skills with a penalty based on how
unrelated they are. The exact penalty is determined by the Gamemaster but can never be a bonus. When determining
distance penalties compare not only the difference between the ideal skill and the one in question but also consider the
task itself for other relevent fields. For example a chemist can use Knowledge: Chemisty to cook with a -15 distance
penalty but a cook can't use Knowledge: Cuisine for chemistry at all.</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The question was asked "What is the average wingspan of an English Sparrow?" To answer this Knowledge: Birds is the most appropriate skill (no distance penalty) although this particular question would have a DC of around 15 anyway. The skill Knowledge: Animals having a penalty of -2 and Knowledge: Biology a penalty of -5. The skills Knowledge: Sparrows and Knowledge: English Sparrow Wings although also have no distance penalty are much less useful then Knowledge: Birds and thus discouraging overly specific skills.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: You want to know how to cut into a cactus for consumption, the ideal skill is Knowledge: Desert Survival which has no penalty but Knowledge: Survival is also appropriate with perhaps a -2 penalty for being more broad whereas Knowledge: Forest Survival has a -10 penalty for trying to apply vaguely similar knowledge to a different situation. Knowledge: Desert Cuisine might have a -15 penalty due to cooks not normally gathering their own ingredients and Knowledge: Plants is too distant with a penalty of -15. However too narrow of a Knowledge skill is hindering since Knowledge: Cactus or Knowledge: Barrel Cactus do not provide any kind of bonus and are less useful as skills. However Memory can also be used if your character has done this before as established by backstory or gameplay with a DC depending on memory basics as described later.</div>
<p>It is possible to use multiple skills when rolling for a task, in which case, for each skill, get the difference of
(skill rank - distance penalty) with a minimum of 0 since more skills can't hinder you. Add together each skill total
then add 3dF + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers so that the dice, ability, and miscellaneous are only added
once, use the ability of the ideal skill.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-MISCELLANEOUS-MODIFIERS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS MODIFIERS</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous modifiers to skill checks include modifiers for circumstances, and bonuses from advantages or powers,
among others.</p>
<p>The higher the total, the better the result. You're usually looking for a total that equals or exceeds a particular
difficulty class (DC), which may be based on another character's traits.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-CRITICAL-SUCCESS"></a>CRITICAL SUCCESS</h3>
<p>If you roll a 20 on the dice when making a check you've scored a <b>critical success</b>. Determine the degree of
success normally and then increase it by one degree. This can turn a low-level success into something more significant,
but more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-fledged success!</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-ACQUIRING-SKILLS"></a>ACQUIRING SKILLS</h2>
<p>When choosing skills try to pick useful categories and the ability most related. It is recommended to take at least
one Expertise due to being versatile in a specific field. Provided below is a list of skills that may be used; it is not
exhaustive but has some useful and common ones. The Gamemaster should check over all skills to make sure they aren't too
broad, narrow, or suspicious (such as Kowledge: Gamemaster you little muchkin).</p>
<p>Give your hero skill ranks by spending character points: 2 skill ranks per character point. Skill ranks do not all
need to be assigned to the same skill. You can split them between different skills, thus allowing you to have two skills
with an odd number of ranks as long as the total of all skills is even. Characters can perform some tasks without any
training, using only raw talent (as defined by their ability ranks), but skilled characters are better at such things.
Those with the right combinations of skills and advantages can even make them as useful as super-powered characters
although very rarely will a superpowered combat-based villian lose to a hero without powers.</p>
<p>You may use <b>Enhanced Trait</b> to raise a skill which would have the same effect except that it is considered the
result of powers and not experience and thus can have modifiers and be lost during a power loss complication etc.</p>
<div style="padding:5px;text-align:center;font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:rgb(153,0,0)">Skill Cost = 1 character point per 2 skill ranks.</div>
<div style="border-style:solid thin rgb(11,83,148);font-size:26px;font-weight:bolder;background-color:rgb(11,83,148);padding:5px;margin:30px 0px;color:rgb(255,255,255);border-radius:10px;clear:both">HOW SKILLS WORK</div>
<p>When you use a skill, make a skill check to see how you do. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or
beat a particular number to use the skill successfully. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.
(See <b>Checks</b>, for more information.)</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-UNTRAINED-SKILL-CHECKS"></a>UNTRAINED SKILL CHECKS</h2>
<p>If your (skill rank - distance penalty) total is 0 or less then the roll is considered untrained with a skill rank
and distance penalty of 0 each. Generally, if you attempt a task requiring a skill you don't have, you make a skill
check as normal. Skill rank doesn't apply because you don't have any ranks in the skill. You do get other modifiers,
however, such as the skill's ability modifier.</p>
<p>Many skills can only be used if you are trained in them. Skills that cannot be used untrained are marked with a "No"
in the "Untrained" column on <b>Table:&nbsp;Skills</b> and listed as "Trained Only" in their descriptions. Attempts to
use these skills untrained automatically fail. In some cases, a skill may have both trained and untrained aspects; if
you do not have any ranks in that skill, you can only use the untrained ones.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-INTERACTION-SKILLS"></a>INTERACTION SKILLS</h2>
<p>Certain skills, called <b>interaction skills</b>, are aimed at dealing with others through social interaction.
Interaction skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get them to cooperate with you in one way or
another. Since interaction skills are intended for dealing with others socially, they have certain requirements.</p>
    <p>First, you must be able to interact with the subject(s) of the skill. They must be aware of you and able to understand you. If they can't hear or understand you for some reason, you have a -5 circumstance penalty to your skill check (see <b>Circumstance Modifiers</b> in <a href="home.html">The Basics</a>).</p>
<p>Interaction skills work best on intelligent subjects, ones with an Intellect rank of -4 or better. You can use them
on creatures with Int -5, but again with a -5 circumstance penalty; they're just too dumb to get the subtleties of your
point. You can't use interaction skills at all on subjects lacking one or more mental abilities such as trying to
convince a rock to be your friend or to be afraid of you.</p>
<p>You can use interaction skills on groups of subjects at once, but only to achieve the same result for everyone. So
you can attempt to use <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> or <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> to convince a
group of something, or <a href="#TOC-INTIMIDATION">Intimidation</a> to cow a crowd, for example, but you can't convince
some individuals of one thing and the rest of another, or intimidate some and not others. The GM decides if a particular
use of an interaction skill is effective against a group, and may apply modifiers depending on the situation. The
general rules for interaction still apply: everyone in the group must be able to hear and understand you, for example,
or you suffer a -5 on your skill check against them. Mindless subjects are unaffected, as usual.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-MANIPULATION-SKILLS"></a>MANIPULATION SKILLS</h2>
<p>Some skills, called <b>manipulation skills</b>, require a degree of fine physical manipulation. You need prehensile
limbs and a Strength rank or some suitable Precise power effect to use manipulation skills effectively. If your physical
manipulation capabilities are impaired in some fashion (such as having your hands tied or full use of only one hand),
the GM may impose a circumstance modifier based on the severity of the impairment. Characters lacking the ability to use
manipulation skills can still have ranks in them and use them to oversee or assist the work of others (see <b>Team
Checks</b>).</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SKILL-BENCHMARKS"></a>SKILL BENCHMARKS</h3>
<p>You can get a general idea of just how good a particular character's skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class guidelines given in <a href="home.html">The Basics</a> along with the rules for routine checks (see <b>Routine
Checks</b>). </p>
<p>For example, a +5 total skill modifier means the character can routinely achieve a result of 15 (a tough task). Safe
to say the character is a pro, able to routinely handle tasks that would prove too much for someone less skilled. A
character with a +10 skill modifier achieve a DC 20 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of expertise,
while a +15 modifier can routinely complete DC 25 (formidable) tasks. At the high end, a +30 skill modifier can
routinely accomplishing the nigh impossible (DC 40 tasks)!</p>

<div style="padding:10px;background-color:rgb(244,204,204)">
<p>There are a number of factors to consider when choosing skills for your character.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-TRAINING-VS.-TALENT"></a>TRAINING VS. TALENT</h3>
<p>In game terms there's no difference between a character who has ranks in a skill because of extensive training and
another whose skill ranks represent a natural talent or aptitude for the skill. Both are considered "trained" in the
skill in game terms. For example, one character might have a high <a href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill based
on the character's extensive training in negotiation, debate, and management. Another character's <a
href="#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill may stem more from personal attractiveness or a knack for getting others to
cooperate, while a third character may have a combination of the two. Feel free to decide for yourself what mix of
training and talent your character's skill ranks represent.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-LIFE-SKILLS"></a>LIFE SKILLS</h3>
<p>When allocating skill ranks for your character consider not just the character's role as a hero but also the various
other skills the character may have picked up in day-to-day life. For example, most adults have some sort of <a
href="#TOC-EXPERTISE">Expertise</a> skill as their occupation with at least 3 to 5 ranks (more if they're especially
good at their job). Some people pick up ranks in <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, although most get by using
the skill untrained. Characters working with technology may have the <a href="#TOC-TECHNOLOGY">Technology</a> skill even
if it doesn't apply to their powers. A particularly welleducated person may have various <a
href="#TOC-EXPERTISE">Expertise</a> skills for jobs they don't even hold. These additional skills help round out a
character and provide some background color and--who knows?--they may turn out to be useful in an adventure at some
point!</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-ADVENTURING-SKILLS"></a>ADVENTURING SKILLS</h3>
<p>Also give some thought to the skills your character needs to be effective in game play. Some are obvious, especially
if they're part of your character concept. A scientist is likely to have ranks in <a
href="#TOC-TECHNOLOGY">Technology</a>. A pilot should have <a href="#TOC-VEHICLES">Vehicles</a>, while a doctor should
have <a href="#TOC-TREATMENT">Treatment</a> in addition to <a href="#TOC-EXPERTISE">Expertise</a>: Physician. Beyond the
obvious and life skills of your character consider "utility skills" like <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>, <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, and <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>, which many characters find useful. A few
ranks in such skills may be a smart investment.</p>

<p>With a successful Athletics check, you can climb along a slope, wall, or other steep incline at your ground speed
rank minus 2 as a move action. A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface can't be climbed without the Wall-crawling
effect of Movement (see <a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a>).</p>
<p>A failed Athletics check indicates you make no progress, and two or more degrees of failure means you fall from
whatever height you attained (unless you are secured with a safety harness or other equipment). Make an Athletics check
to catch yourself (DC equal to the initial check + 10). Someone else within arm's reach can also make an Athletics check
to catch you with the same DC. If your attempt to catch someone else gets more than one degree of failure, you fall as
well.</p>
<p>Since you can't easily move to avoid attacks, you are vulnerable while climbing unless you accept a +5 increase in
the DC. Any time you fail a resistance check while climbing, make an immediate Athletics check against the DC of the
climb. Failure means you fall.</p>
<p>At the GM's discretion, certain kinds of climbing attempts might require tools like ropes, pitons, harness, and so
forth. Attempting such a climb without tools incurs a -5 circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>You get a bonus or penalty based on your mass rank which is (2 - your mass rank)*4. (See <b>Chapter 8 Action &amp;
Adventure: Relative Size Rules</b>).</p>

<p>The result of an Athletics check is the distance (in feet) you can clear in a running long-jump. If you make a
standing jump, divide the distance in half. If you make a vertical jump (straight up) divide the distance by 5, and if
you make a standing vertical jump, divide it by 10.</p>
<p>Your Athletics bonus + 10 is the base distance you can jump under routine circumstances. So a hero with a +10
Athletics bonus can make a routine long-jump of 20 feet, a standing long-jump of 10 feet, a vertical jump of 4 feet, and
a standing vertical jump of 2 feet on a routine basis.</p>
<p>You get a bonus or penalty based on your mass rank which is (2 - your mass rank)*4. (See <b>Chapter 8 Action &amp;
Adventure: Relative Size Rules</b>)</p>
<p>If you want your hero to jump tens, hundreds, thousands of feet, or even miles, see <a

<p>You can make a DC 15 Athletics (Str) check as a free action to run faster: one or more degree of success increases
your ground speed rank by +1 for one round. However doing this for more than one move action in a row is likely to
require some kind of Stamina check.</p>

<p>A successful DC 10 Athletics check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the check
fails, you make no progress through the water during the action. With more than one degree of failure, you go under. If
underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning (see <b>Suffocation</b>).</p>
<p>Swimming can't be performed untrained, however it can be performed to a lesser degree with Extra Effort (for a
Victory Point you can gain the full benefits see <b>Heroic Feat</b>). If you use Extra Effort then a DC 15 Athletics
(Sta) check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 3 as a standard action in order to dog paddle or tred
water.</p>

<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Fighting</div>
<p>You're trained with a particular type of close attack, giving you a bonus to your attack checks with it equal to your
skill rank (see <b>Attack Check</b>). Each close attack is a separate Close Combat skill with its own rank, and
encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster's discretion (see
<b>Arrays</b> in <a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a>).</p>
<p>So a hero might have Close Combat: Swords, but Close Combat: Melee Weapons is too broad. Close Combat: Unarmed is an
option, meaning skill with unarmed strikes like punches and kicks. However, this bonus does not apply to other forms of
unarmed combat maneuvers, including, but not limited to, grabbing or tripping.</p>
<p>The bonus from a Close Combat skill applies only to attack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses,
countering, power checks, or other uses. Keep in mind that the distance penalty in this case is an attack penalty. In
this system any weapon can be used untrained as a +0 skill modifier.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common types of Close Combat: Improvised Weapons, Swords, Spears, Clubs, Daggers, Tonfa,
Nunchaku, Sythe, Flamethrower, Chainsaw, and Halberd.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-COMMON-KNOWLEDGE"></a>COMMON KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Intellect</div>
<p>Also known as common sense. This skill is much like Knowledge but can be used untrained to an extent and covers more
basic things. Common Knowledge is specific to the time period and culture and can only be used untrained if you have
lived in that culture (during that time period).</p>
<p>This area covers simple living knowledge. For example in modern United States it is common knowledge that you won't
get a speeding ticket for going 5 MPH over the speed limit. It's also common knowledge that Milk needs to be kept
refrigerated (even if you don't know why it goes sour), and that a stitch in time saves nine. It is understood that the
most common language is English, the drinking age is 21, knowing how close people are to each other when talking, and
how to be polite.</p>
<p>Although the DCs tend to be low the reason why this skill exists is to emphasize the cultural differences across time
and place. For example in the southern United States in the 1860s (the time of the civil war) it is common knowledge
that black people were inferior to white people although in modern times United States that is no longer the case (as
common knowledge anyway since you can still believe that independently). More examples are that blood letting and witch
burning were common in the Middle ages in Europe, when and how to sacrifice to Zeus was common in ancient Greece, and
how deeply to bow is common in Japan.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated any Common Knowledge has a default time period the same as the time period of the
setting.</p>
<p>Some more examples of Common Knowledge are: Earth, Mars, 1940s Southern United States Black Community, and rural
community in Kentucky.</p>

<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Presence &#8226; Interaction</div>
<p>Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you want them to believe. It covers things like acting,
bluffing, fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.</p>
<p>Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story. Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move action by taking a -5 penalty to your check.</p>
<p>Deception is usually opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check but may also be opposed by
Deception (Int) to recognize deceptive techniques being used.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-BLUFFING"></a>BLUFFING</h3>
<p>Make a Deception check to tell a believable lie or get someone do go along with you. Note that believability and risk
are according to the character you are trying to deceive.</p>
<p>A bluff is opposed by the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances
weigh heavily on the outcome. Two circumstances can work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what you ask
goes against the target's self-interest, nature, or personality. Ordinary deception can only do so much, for anything
beyond this you will need the powers of either <b>Mind Control</b> or <b>Mental Transform</b>. In the case of the last
row on the above table even if telling the truth people might not believe you. However if the existence of super powers
is well known then there are many circumstances that might not seem so unbelievable.</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The sorcerer Tim leads a group of knights to a cave guarded by a terrible monster who has slain dozens of knights. Upon arrival Tim points to an ordinary looking bunny and tells them that it is the monster. Despite being the truth the knights refuse to believe it, charge in, fight a hopeless battle lossing several men, and retreat. Maybe if Tim explained that the bunny was not ordinary the knights would have considered it.</div>
<p>If it's important, you can distinguish between a deception that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands some kind of risk, and the resistance check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target doesn't so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check succeeds
by 11 or more, he has seen through the deception, and would have refused even if it had not placed unusual demands on
him (that is, even without the +10 modifier).</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DISGUISE"></a>DISGUISE</h3>
<p>You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance. Your Deception check result determines the
effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others' perception check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly so
you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Disguise is heavily dependent on circumstances: favorable ones include appropriate costuming and a subject resembling
your normal appearance, while unfavorable circumstances include disguising yourself as a member of a different race or
sex, or not having sufficient props (which can be up to a -5 modifier). If you are impersonating a particular
individual, anyone who knows that individual gets a circumstance bonus to the <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>
check: regular associates get a +2, while friends get a +5 and intimate loved ones a +10.</p>
<p>Successfully acting like who you appear to be may also require a Deception check with a DC equal to the observer's <a
href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check, modified by familiarity if the observer knows the subject well, as mentioned
previously.</p>
<p>A disguise normally requires at least 10 minutes of preparation. The GM makes Perception checks for those who
encounter you immediately upon meeting you and each hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-FEINTING"></a>FEINTING</h3>
<p>You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a standard
action opposed by your target's <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>. If your Deception check succeeds, the target is
vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of your next round (see <b>Vulnerable</b> condition).</p>
<p>Not to be confused with fainting, although playing dead is a possible deception you'll need to fall prone reguardless
of your check and need to stay that way for a turn.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INNUENDO"></a>INNUENDO</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to send covert messages using word-play and double-meanings while apparently talking about
other things. The DC for a basic message is 10. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new information have
DCs of 15 or 20, respectively. The recipient of the message must make a <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> check against
the same DC to understand it.</p>

<p>Anyone listening in on your innuendo can attempt a insight check against the message DC. If successful, the
eavesdropper notices a message hidden in your conversation. If the eavesdropper gets at least two degrees of success, he
also understands the message. Whether trying to send or pick up on a message, more than one degree of failure on the
check means the receiver misinterprets the message in some fashion.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-TRICKING"></a>TRICKING</h3>
<p>You can use Deception to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action, such as trying to hit you while
standing in front of an electrical junction box or at the edge of a precipice. If your Deception check opposed by <a
href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> succeeds, your opponent is heedless of the potential danger and may hit the junction box
or lose his balance and fall, if his attack against you fails. (On the other hand, if the attack succeeds, it might slam
you into the junction box or send you flying off the edge. You're taking a risk.)</p>
<p>More than one degree of failure on the Deception check means you put yourself in a bad position; you are vulnerable
against the target's attacks until the start of your next round!</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-EXPERTISE"></a>EXPERTISE</h2>
<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Intellect &#8226; Trained Only</div>
<p>Expertise is a broad skill encompassing knowledge and training in a variety of specialized fields, particularly
professional disciplines and scholarship. The field of expertise does not need to be one that is considered a profession
but must involve a skill set or lifestyle of some kind. Each is considered a separate skill and training in each is
acquired separately, so a former police officer turned district attorney might have Expertise: Police Officer and
Expertise: Law, each with their own ranks, for example.</p>
<p>If you are trained in an Expertise, you can practice and make a living at it. You know how to use the tools of that
trade, perform the profession's daily tasks, supervise untrained helpers, and handle common problems. For example,
someone trained in Expertise: Sailor knows how to tie basic knots, tend and repair sails, and stand a deck watch at sea.
The GM sets DCs for specific tasks using the guidelines provided in <a href="home.html">The Basics</a> under
<b>Checks</b>, keeping in mind that most job-related checks should be considered routine (see <b>Routine
Checks</b>).</p>
<p>You can also make Expertise checks to see if your character knows the answer to a particular question related to the
area of expertise, such as a scientist confronted with a technical issue, or a lawyer considering a legal question. The
DC is 10 for easy questions, 15 for basic questions, and 20 or higher for difficult questions. You can usually answer
questions as a routine check, and the GM may make a check for you in secret, so you won't know whether or not your
character's skill is entirely up to the task.</p>
<p>The ability modifier for Expertise is typically Intellect, but some areas of expertise may call for different
abilities, perhaps depending on the task involved. For example, a technical expert might rely on Intellect to answer
questions and handle day-to-day procedures, but need Dexterity to perform the actual functions of the job. Performance
skills, such as acting or music, may rely on Presence. The GM sets the ability modifier as needed for the specific
Expertise check.</p>
<p>Characters with expertise in a profession are also assumed to be licensed or certified to practice it, if necessary.
Problems like licensing issues, professional rivalries, and so forth can be handled as complications (see
<b>Complications</b>).</p>
<p>The GM may allow some Expertise checks to be made untrained, especially for "unskilled" areas, measuring broad
general knowledge and life experience, but even then an untrained Expertise check cannot be routine, and the character
can only handle easy or basic tasks or questions (DC 10-15).</p>

<div style="background-color:rgb(252,229,205)">
<p>The following are examples of suitable areas of Expertise. This list is by no means exhaustive, the GM should feel
free to add to or modify this list as needed to suit the game and the characters in it. Note that Wizardry listed here
besides being the application of Knowledge: Magic might also represent a skill set such as being able to translate
magical tomes or knowing about other planes of existence etc.</p>
<p>Art, Boy Scouts, Business, Carpentry, Cooking, Criminal, Current Events, Dance, History, Journalism, Law, Law

<p>The GM may decide that training in an Expertise skill provides some ability to deal with tasks covered by other,
related, skills with a circumstance penalty to the skill check (see distance penalty at the top).</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Figuring out a particular clue involving a government conspiracy requires an investigation or Expertise: Politics check. However, the GM allows a hero to substitute an Expertise: Law check with a -2 circumstance penalty, as the knowledge is related, but outside the character's specific field. Expertise: Journalism might suffer a -5 penalty, but could still be useful (especially if the character works a legal or political beat as a reporter), while Expertise: Cooking is no help at all, and cannot be used for the check (unless the player comes up with a very clever explanation!)</div>

<p>You can tell someone's true intentions and feelings by paying attention to things like body language, inflection, and
your own intuition.</p>
<p>A successful Insight check allows you to resist the effects of some interaction skills, becoming aware of the other
person's true intent. You can also use the skill to tell when someone is behaving oddly or for assessing
trustworthiness.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DETECT-ILLUSION"></a>DETECT ILLUSION</h3>
<p>The GM makes a secret Insight check to determine if your hero senses the true nature of an illusion (DC 10 + Illusion
rank). Success means you pick up on a flaw in the illusion, sensing it is not real. See <b>Illusion</b> effect.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DETECT-INFLUENCE"></a>DETECT INFLUENCE</h3>
<p>You can make a Insight check to notice someone acting under outside influence. The DC is 10 + the rank of the effect
or skill affecting the subject. If you succeed, you notice the subject is not acting entirely of his or her own will.
Three or more degrees give you a general idea of what is influencing them (and perhaps even whom, depending on the
situation and the Gamemaster's judgment).</p>

<p>With an Insight check, opposed by <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>, you can tell if someone is trustworthy and
honorable (or not) upon meeting them. You can also make an Insight check (DC 20) to evaluate a social situation, getting
a feel for the overall mood and prevailing attitudes. Two or more degrees of failure on either check mean you
misinterpret the signs, so the GM may make these checks for you in secret.</p>

<p>Make an Intimidation check, opposed by the target's insight or Will defense (whichever has the highest bonus). If
your check succeeds, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for actions taken in your presence. That is, the
target retains his normal attitude, but will talk, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while
intimidated. The target cooperates, but won't necessarily obey your every whim or do anything that would directly
endanger him.</p>
<p>If you perform some action that makes you more imposing, you gain a circumstance bonus on your Intimidation check. If
your target clearly has a superior position, you suffer a circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>With more than one degree of failure on your check, the target may actually do the opposite of what you want! Succeed
or fail, a target's true attitude towards you generally becomes hostile after you attempt an Intimidation check, even if
they go along with you for the moment.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DEMORALIZING"></a>DEMORALIZING</h3>

<p>You can intimidate a whole group of minions--who can all see and hear you--with a single check. If the group has you
at a disadvantage, you suffer the usual circumstance penalty on your check. Compare your check result against a single
resistance check made by the GM for the entire group. Your Intimidation check must have the same effect on every member
of the group (that is, you cannot demoralize some and coerce others, for example).</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The Rock is facing down Packrat in one of his many bolt holes around Capital City when the big rat commands a pack of his street thieves to keep The Rock from following him. The gang of kids steps forward to get in The Rock's way. The Rock has no interest in hurting a bunch of kids, so he bellows, "Get outta the way or I'll knock your blocks off!" and his player decides to use The Rock's routine Intimidation check of 18 to attempt to coerce the entire group of minions into moving out of his way. The street kids are all Thugs, so they have a resistance rank of 0 (their <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a> and Will ranks are tied). Since Rocky is attempting the same effect on every member of the group, he makes a single opposed check. Unfortunately, the GM rolls a 13, which isn't enough to beat The Rock's 18.

miles), find the time measurement for that distance, and add 2. So searching 60 square feet (roughly an 8 ft. by 8 ft.
room) takes the time rank of 60 feet (rank 1), plus 2, or 1 minute (time rank 3). Searching a square mile takes the time
rank of 1 mile (rank 8), plus 2, or two hours (time rank 10).</p>

can be analyzed (see <b>Analyze Evidence</b>.) If the check fails, an analysis can be done, but with a -5 penalty for
highly unfavorable circumstances. With more than one degree of failure, the evidence is ruined and no analysis can be
done. On the other hand, two or more degrees of success provide a +2 circumstance bonus to later analysis.</p>

<div style="padding:10px;background-color:rgb(244,204,204)">
<p>Knowledge skills measure what your character knows about various things, whether you know anything about them or not.
It's fairly easy to measure what a hero knows by making the appropriate skill check or looking at the routine check
value of (bonus +10).</p>
<p>However, players may know things their characters do not, either because of the player's life experience or knowledge
of the game and its rules (and source material). In this case the Gamemaster may prefer players limit themselves to only
what Knowledge skills their heroes have rather than what they may or may not know about a given situation. The GM may
bend this rule by allowing a player to spend a victory point to have a character act upon something he or she would have
no way of knowing, calling it a "hunch" or a "lucky guess" (a version of the inspiration rule). See <b>victory
points</b>.</p>
<p>If there's a question as to how to handle an issue of player versus character expertise in the game, consult your
Gamemaster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Knowledge is a broad skill encompassing a variety of specialized fields. Each is considered a separate skill and
knowledge in each is acquired separately, so a person migth have Knowledge: Nature and Knowledge: Forests, each with
their own ranks, for example.</p>
<p>The reason why a character would put ranks in Knowledge instead of Application (or rather in addition to) is because
Knowledge is above and addition to Application in that when wanting to roll Knowledge use both skills (and possibly
more) including the distance penalty as normal but if the Knowledge and Application are of the same things then there is
0 distance. Since application is always more useful then knowledge there is no mechanical reason to buy a knowledge
skill that could instead be an application skill although there may be a roleplay reason in that the knowledge
represents knowing more than you have experienced such as a student. Although if the Knowledge skill + application skill
of same name + Int is more than the power level limitations will allow (power level +10) then the Knowledge skill should
be lowered.</p>
<p>All other skills, including Expertise, can have a Knowledge equivalent. The following are other examples of suitable
areas of Knowledge. This list is by no means exhaustive, the GM should feel free to add to or modify this list as needed
to suit the game and the characters in it.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Trivia</b>: This represents a collection of random facts that are commonly used in trivia contests.
None of them should be obvious and few of them useful.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge: Jokes</b>: Much like trivia above this is a collection of commonly told jokes. It is important to make
the distinction between jokes and riddles since they are completely different mind sets and some words are defined
following. The following definitions may not match dictionary results exactly but these are useful in order to
differentiate between them since these definitions are unique and don't overlap. <b>Joke</b>: A question (or statement)
often involving a pun whose purpose is humorous. <b>Riddle</b>: A serious of statements posed as an intellectual puzzle
that uses unusual descriptions and phrases to describe a common object (see example below). <b>Paradox</b>: a situation
set up in a self-contradicting way in order to demonstrate a logical flaw. <b>Conundrum</b>: a series of statements
ending in a question that are problematic or unusual that are told in order to invoke thinking and discussion of
topic.</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Joke Example</b>: Me: "Did you hear that Gary Gygax the co-creator of Dungeons &amp; Dragons died?"<br />(he died on the 4th of March 2008)<br />You: "Yeah, he's rolling in his grave now."</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Riddle Example</b>:<br />In a marble hall white as milk,<br />lined with skin as soft as silk.<br />Within a fountain crystal-clear,<br />a golden apple doth appear.<br />No doors there are to this stronghold,<br />yet thieves break in to steal its gold.<br />What is it?</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Paradox Example</b>: The time paradox is sometimes stated as a reason why time travel into the past is impossible. The set up is simple but lengthy: a man (A) goes back in time and kills himself (B) in the past but by doing so it ensures that the present (A) versions can never come to exist and thus he (A) never existed to be able to travel back in time. And since he (A) never got the chance to travel back in time then that means that he (A) could not have killed himself (B) in the past. And since the past version (B) wasn't killed the present version (A) is able to exist and thus able to travel back in time and causing an infinite loop. Some people provide a reason why time travel backwards is able to exist without causing any time paradoxes such as the alternate timeline theory. It states that any time you change anything in the past it creates a separate timeline branch off thus you can't change any events in your own timeline but can still create alternate outcomes.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Conundrum Example</b>: I still have my grandfather's axe. I've taken good care of it even replacing its handle twice and its head three times. But is it still my grandfather's axe or something new?</div>
<p>For those of you who want to know the answer to the riddle above, it is the eighth in the list: heaven, clock,
rainbow, dragon, teeth, man, mountain, egg, death, fog, mirror, time, ring, shadow, snowman, treasure, human life,
chicken, axe, river, waterfall, moss, elevator, stairs, the sun, the moon, and kings.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-MEMORY"></a>MEMORY</h2>
<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Intellect</div>
<p>This is your ability to remember past events. This can be used untrained to represent that anyone with intelligence
can remember to some degree. Memory checks only apply to remembering events that have been established by backstory or
gameplay but does not allow you to use this skill in place of a Knowledge check.</p>
<p>The DC of remembering depends on many factors such as: how important the event was to you, how involved you were, how
much you saw and understood, how recent the event was, how much detail you are trying to recall, whether you were
actively trying to remember it, etc. If the player can remember the information then their character can remember it too
(assuming their character experienced it) without the need of a Memory check unless there are penalties such as head
trama or exhaustion.</p>
<p>Note that <b>Mind Reading</b> allows a DC 20 to read your own mind with perfect clarity, thus automatically passing
any possible memory check.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-PERCEPTION"></a>PERCEPTION</h2>
<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Awareness</div>
<p>Use this skill to notice and pick up on things. Discerning details--such as clearly hearing conversation or reading
fine text--requires at least three degrees of success on the Perception check.</p>
<p>In general, you have a -1 circumstance penalty to Perception checks for every 15 feet between you and what you
are</p>
<p>trying to perceive. So hearing a noise from 60 feet away is a -4 modifier to your Perception check, for example.</p>
<p>The GM usually makes Perception checks secretly so you don't know whether there was nothing to notice or you simply
failed to notice it. The common sorts of Perception checks are:</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-HEARING"></a>HEARING</h3>
<p>Make a check against a DC based on how loud the noise is or against an opposed <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>
check. Normal conversation or unarmed combat is DC 0, a soft noise DC 10, a loud noise is DC -10 such as metal striking
metal, and a very loud noise such as a gun shot is DC -20. The DC gets a +5 per inch of material that is in the way such
as a door or solid wall in addition to the -1 per 15 ft distance penalty (not to be confused with the skill distance
penalty). While you're asleep, hearing something well enough to wake up is +15 DC (see <b>conditions</b> for more
information on sleep).</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SEEING"></a>SEEING</h3>
<p>Make a check against a DC based on how visible the object is or against an opposed <a href="#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a>
check. Something in plain sight is DC 0, while something subtle or easily over-looked may be DC 5, 10 or more. Visual
perception is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the <b><a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a></b> skill) or
to notice a concealed object (see the <b><a href="#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a></b> skill).</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-OTHER-SENSES"></a>OTHER SENSES</h3>
<p>You can make Perception checks involving other sense types as well (see <a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a> for more
on sense types). Noticing something obvious to a sense is DC 0. Less obvious things are DC 10 or so, hidden things DC 20
or more, and discerning details requires at least three degrees of success, as usual.</p>
<p>You can make a Perception check every time you have the opportunity to notice something new. As a move action, you
can attempt to notice something you failed (or believe you failed) to notice previously.</p>
<p>Various sensory effects provide modifiers on Perception checks (see <a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a>).</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-PERSUASION"></a>PERSUASION</h2>
<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Presence &#8226; Interaction</div>
<p>You're skilled in dealing with people, from etiquette and social graces to a way with words and public speaking, all
of which helps to get your point across, make a good impression, negotiate, and generally win people over to your way of
seeing things.</p>
<p>In negotiations, all participants roll Persuasion checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve
cases where two advocates plead opposing cases before a third party.</p>
<p>Non-player characters each have an initial attitude towards you or your cause. The GM chooses the character's initial
attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a specific
circumstance or complication may call for a different attitude.</p>
<p>You can improve others' attitudes with a DC 15 Persuasion check. Success improves the subject's attitude by one step,
while every two additional degrees of success improve it by another step (so two steps at three degrees, three steps at
five degrees, and so forth). Failure means no change, and more than a degree of failure worsens the subject's attitude
by one step! In the case of a hostile subject, they may outright attack or otherwise interfere with you if their
attitude worsens.</p>

<p>Persuading someone is at least a standard action, usually quite a bit longer. The GM decides if you can persuade at
all once a conflict has broken out! Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can only be persuaded so
far; you can try again in the same scene, but you check against the subject's initial attitude, and may end up worsening
it rather than improving it!</p>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The heroes must convince the imperious King of Atlantis that the surface world is not responsible for recent attacks against his kingdom in order to avert a war. The king's attitude is unfavorable towards these surface-world interlopers to begin with. The team's spokesperson makes a Persuasion attempt and gets a check result of 22, a success with two degrees total. That shifts the king's attitude one step, to indifferent. He's inclined to continue negotiating with the heroes and willing to place the assault on the surface world on-hold for the time-being. The heroes try to convince the king further, but any additional checks need at least the same degree of success as the first to get his attitude to favorable, where he is willing to call off the attack, and more than one degree of failure on any check moves his attitude to hostile, where he orders the intruders arrested and the attack to begin at once!</div>
<p>If a Persuasion check fails, trying again is futile; the subject is too set against your arguments. At the GM's
discretion, you can try again when the situation changes in some way: you find a new approach to your argument, new
evidence appears, and so forth. The GM may consider you at a disadvantage in further negotiations, imposing a
circumstance penalty as well.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:28px;clear:both"><a name="TOC-RANGED-COMBAT"></a>RANGED COMBAT</h2>
<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Dexterity</div>
<p>You're trained with a particular type of ranged attack, giving you a bonus to your attack checks with it equal to
your skill rank (see <b>Attack Check</b> in <a href="home.html">The Basics</a> and in <a
href="8-action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>). Each ranged attack is a separate Ranged Combat skill with
its own rank, and encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array may be considered one power, at the
Gamemaster's discretion (see <b>Arrays</b> in <a href="6-powers.html">Powers</a> for more information).</p>
<p>So a hero might have Ranged Combat: Small Arms or Ranged Combat: Fire Control (a ranged damage power), but Ranged
Combat: Powers is too broad. Ranged Combat: Throwing is an option and includes both thrown weapons and objects a
character simply picks up and throws.</p>
<p>The bonus from a Ranged Combat skill applies only to attack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses,
countering, power checks, or other uses. Keep in mind that the distance penalty in this case is an attack penalty. In
this system any weapon can be used untrained as a +0 skill modifier.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common types of Ranged Combat: Small Arms, Throwing, Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles,
Bows, Crossbows, and Slings.</p>

<p>You can perform dexterous feats of legerdemain such as palming small objects, picking pockets, slipping out of
restraints, and so forth. Stage magicians use Sleight of Hand legitimately as a performance skill, but it is most
commonly known for its criminal applications.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-CONCEALING"></a>CONCEALING</h3>
<p>You can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item on your person, making your check result the DC of an <a
href="#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a> or <a href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check to find it.</p>
<p>In order to conceal a small item it must be possible to hide it somewhere. For example if you are stripped naked and
have no hidden compartments then hiding a baseball sized item would be rather impossible. Or if you are trying to hide
an orb of fire and your clothes are not fireproof enough, even if you are, then hiding the object won't be so
simple.</p>
<p>You can also make a Sleight of Hand check to plant a small object on someone, slip something into their pocket, drop
something into their drink, place a tiny radio tracer on them, and so forth. To plant the object, you must get a check
result of 20 or higher, regardless of the opponent's check result. The opponent notices the attempt if his check result
beats yours, whether you succeed in planting the item or not.</p>

no cover or concealment, since that means you are standing out in plain sight. Of course, if someone isn't looking
directly at you (you're sneaking up from behind, for example), then you have concealment relative to that person.</p>
<p>If you have the ability to cause a momentary distraction (such as a smoke pellet or flash bang) then you can make a
Stealth check while people are aware of you. When others turn their attention from you, make a Stealth check if you can
reach cover or concealment of some kind. Just like for Dodging area effects you must be close enough to the cover that
you can move there within 1 second (speed - 2). This check also has a -5 penalty because you have to move quickly.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-TAILING"></a>TAILING</h3>
<p>You can use Stealth to tail someone at your normal speed. This assumes you have some cover or concealment (crowds of
people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject is worried about being followed, he can make a <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check (opposed by your Stealth check) every time he changes course (goes around a
street corner, exits a building, and so on). If he is unsuspecting, he only gets one <a
href="#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a> check for the scene. If the subject notices you, you may make a <a
href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> check, opposed by <a href="#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>. If you succeed, you manage to
pass off your presence as coincidence and can continue tailing. A failed <a href="#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a> check,
or being noticed a second time, means the subject knows something is up and reacts accordingly.</p>

<p>The ability to create plans, methods, or series of maneuvers for obtaining a specific goal or result (thank you <a

<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Intellect &#8226; Trained Only &#8226; Manipulation &#8226; Requires Tools</div>
<p>Technology covers operating, building, repairing, and generally working with technological devices and equipment.
Without the proper tools or equipment, you take a -5 penalty to Technology checks for highly unfavorable circumstances.
Various Expertise such as Criminal, Scientist, Engineer etc include technology but you can still take Technology as the
skill itself. Technology often uses Dexterity for applications.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-OPERATING"></a>OPERATING</h3>
<p>Most routine operations of technological equipment don't require a skill check and can be done untrained. Using an
unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from simple (DC
10) to highly advanced (DC 25 or more).</p>

<p>The difficulty and time required to make an item depends on its complexity, as shown on the <b>Building Items</b>
table. If your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item after the necessary time. If the check fails, you did
not produce a usable end result, and any time and materials are wasted. More than one degree of failure on the check may
produce an accident or other unfortunate side-effect at the GM's discretion.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-REPAIRING"></a>REPAIRING</h3>
<p>You can also use Technology to repair damaged items, with a -5 to the DC to build the item and -2 to the time rank
required. So you can perform repairs on a complex item in eight hours (time rank 12) with a DC of 20. Failure on the
check means you spend the time, but make no progress. Two or more degrees of failure may indicate further damage to the
item or an accident similar to building it.</p>
<p>You can reduce the time rank to build or repair an item by 1 by taking a -5 penalty to your skill check.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:16px;color:rgb(0,0,0);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;clear:both"><a name="TOC-JURY-RIGGING"></a>JURY-RIGGING</h3>
<p>You can also attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. Doing this reduces the repair DC by an additional 5 (for a
total of -10 to the DC to build the item), and allows you to make the Technology check as a standard action. However, a
jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem, and the repair only lasts until the end of the scene. The jury-rigged
item must be fully repaired thereafter, and cannot be jury-rigged again until it is fully repaired.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-DEMOLITIONS"></a>DEMOLITIONS</h3>
<p>Careful placement of an explosive against a fixed structure can maximize damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
structure. This requires at least a minute and a DC 10 Technology check. The GM makes the check, so you don't know
exactly how well you have done until the explosive goes off. For every two full degrees of success, the explosive deals
+5 damage to the structure. Failure means the explosive does not go off as planned, while more than one degree of
failure means the charge goes off while you are setting it! In all cases, the explosive deals normal damage to all other
targets.</p>
<p>You can make an explosive device more difficult to disarm. To do so, choose a disarm difficulty class before making
your check to set the detonator. Your DC to set the detonator is the desired disarm DC. Failure means the explosive
fails to go off as planned. Two or more degrees of failure mean the explosive goes off as the detonator is being
installed!</p>
<p>Disarming an explosive also requires a Technology check. The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the
detonator chose a higher disarm DC (previously). If you fail the check, you do not disarm the explosive. With more than
a degree of failure, the explosive goes off. Setting or disarming a detonator is a standard action.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-INVENTING"></a>INVENTING</h3>

for details.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-color:rgb(153,0,0)"><a name="TOC-SECURITY"></a>SECURITY</h3>
<p>You can use Technology to disarm or sabotage various security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This
takes at least a minute, possibly longer, at the GM's discretion. The GM makes your Technology check secretly so you
don't necessarily know right away if you have succeeded. The Gamemaster sets the DC of the check based on the level of
security:</p>

<p>Failure on your skill check means nothing happens, but you can keep trying. More than one degree of failure sets off
the security or trap, if it is possible to do so. You may increase the DC by 5 for preventing your tampering from being
noticed.</p>
<p>The DCs listed for prisons are for the inmate to escape, the DC for an outside force breaking someone out might be
different depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Super-max security (aka a super-prison) is a maximum security prison designed to hold super villains. Power negation
is standard along with higher than maximum security protocols which makes escape impossible. It is not uncommon for such
a prison to also have a super hero (or super technology) to flawlessly monitor all activity or predict the next escape
attempt etc.</p>

<div style="padding:5px;background-color:rgb(249,203,156);font-style:italic">Awareness</div>
<p>You can follow trails and track using your senses. If you are tracking a living being in an atmosphere, and are not
using any exotic senses, then smell (Olfactory) is the only trail directly left behind with a base DC of 10. You move at
your ground speed - 1, for DC +5 you can move at full speed. Foot prints can also be left behind directly under certain
circumstances, such as snow or mud, but may be false. Following a sent trail (if your sense of smell is acute) or
following correct foot prints only requires Tracking (Awe). Following foot prints that are not easy to see, get
interfered with by another's foot prints or are false is a higher DC of Tracking (Awe). Following footprints or a sent
trail can be done untrained.</p>
<p>For other clues, such as broken twigs, you see them as a result of something travelling but they might not be
helpful. This can't be done untrained. Following small clues of a trail might require periodic Perception (Awe) checks
and Tracking (Int).</p>
