<div class="page-header-red">COMMENTARY</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<p>This section was supposed to include a list of reasons behind every single change but screw that. Instead this is
more like author commentary where I might say anything semi-relevant including formulas and reasons for changes.</p>
<p><b>Mission Statement:</b> The purpose of this system is to provide a universal system (more so than GURPS)
that will allow any character from any story to be created in a balanced way. This will allow you to have an ultimate
showdown of ultimate destiny by simply making character sheets for each of them. Although this system can create
ANY character (minus the known limitations) some characters in their source material are not consistent enough.</p>
<p><b>Known limitations</b> of this system. It only works for building single characters. It sucks at building armies, cities,
and machines that multiple people built. There are also some known holes, that is things that are not covered by these
rules, such as a sword of dragon slaying (although I have an idea for that).</p>
<p><b>SNAFU</b>. I changed the game to use 3dF for several reasons (see below) one of which is the ranks and measurements
table. And while this is a step in the right direction it's now a little inconsistent with DCs. Each unit of ability,
skill, or power etc represents a double effectiveness however DC 4 is not beyond the best of human achievement.
While it makes sense for powers to double in effectiveness (to fight against the law of diminishing return and because they
are all superhuman) it doesn't make sense for skills: every rank counts towards a DC and is therefore useful
but human achievement is measured with more granularity than 2^n. Thus the only solution is to declare
that powers double but skills don't and give them separate rank/measurement tables. This would require a complete overhaul
(and thus be version 4.0) and although it might not require much conversion the implications are massive and thus
requires a lot of consideration and planning.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MISCELLANEOUS-CHANGES">MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES</h3>
<p><a href="6-powers\effects\effect-descriptions\remote-sensing-sensory.html">Remote Sensing</a> was changed so that you
can only use it on places that are well-known to prevent people from seeing on the other side of a wall that can't be
seen through with <a
href="6-powers\effects\effect-descriptions\senses-sensory.html#TOC-PENETRATES-CONCEALMENT">Penetrates Concealment
(Vision)</a>. I also moved the ability to "feel" it to the <b>Noticeable</b> flaw to better reflect real life: if
someone is nearby and watching you, you can pick up on subtle hints from peripheral vision etc but if someone is far
away watching with a telescope or hidden camera there is no way to detect it. And since <a
href="6-powers\effects\effect-descriptions\remote-sensing-sensory.html">Remote Sensing</a> is like a telescope there
should not be anyway to notice it by default.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DICE-CHANGE">DICE CHANGE</h3>
<p>Anyone who has played Mutants &amp; Masterminds 3rd edition (the one this is based on) will notice that I changed it
from a d20 system to a 3dF. The reason is the ranks and measurements table used: each rank represents double the value
of the previous. So in the M&amp;M 3e if an average adult (strength 0) rolled a strength check to lift a heavy object he
has a 5% chance to multiply his normal strength by 2^20 (by rolling a 20) which is a difference between lifting 50
pounds and 26,000 tons: this is absurd. He's got average human strength he shouldn't be able to do this! That's one
reason why I changed to 3dF so that he only has a 4% chance to get +3 (ignoring critical) that's only 8 times as strong
which is still hard to believe but much more realistic.</p>
<p>Switching to 3dF puts much more emphasis on ranks than on luck, as it should since each rank is doubly effective.
Since fudge dice also have negative numbers they represent doing worse than average where your rank represents your
average instead of being your average -10. Six sided dice are also much cheaper and easier to get a hold of so that
substitutions can be made, as opposed to not having a d20 in which case software is the only possible substitute. And the last
reason to use 3dF is that it has a bell curve which is usually 0, indeed most rolls should be +0 by definition of being
your average, 1d20 does not have an average for a single roll.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-WILL-DEFENSE-RANT">WILL DEFENSE RANT</h3>
<p>I changed Will defense from using Awareness to Presence. This is an easy change to defend. I'll start
with a description of each.</p>
<p><b>Awareness</b>: Awareness describes common sense and intuition, what some might call "wisdom." Simply put it is
your ability to sense what is going on. Your Awareness modifier applies to Insight and Perception skill checks.
<b>Presence</b>: Presence is force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability. Your Presence modifier
applies to Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion skill checks. <b>Will defense</b>: It measures mental stability,
level-headedness, determination, self-confidence, self-awareness, and willpower, used to resist mental or spiritual
attacks.</p>
<p>Notice how each of those terms for Will defense fit better for Presence than Awareness, even self-awareness, despite
the name, is more about internal awareness instead of external awareness and is a part of personality all are traits of
Presence. In essence Awareness is for senses Presence is free will and force of will, obviously Presence should be the
one that resists a mental attack.</p>
<p>I think I know why Will defense was using Awareness is because it was based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons which uses the
equivalent Wisdom. But D&amp;D has more of a reason for using Wisdom because most Will saves are defending against magic
and magic or spiritual attacks are more about Wisdom than Charisma. But even then Will saves (and Will defense) are more
about force of will than about spiritual awareness etc so it should still be Charisma which, according to Charisma
casters, is force of will which would also make Charisma not useless but I'm getting off topic.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ABOUT-RULES">ABOUT RULES</h3>
<p>"Must we have rules? Can't we just play?" You could but I wouldn't (obviously otherwise I wouldn't be writing this
up). There are reasons why you might want rules and reasons why you don't want rules and here are the 2 lists that I
came up with.</p>
<p>Please note that the number of reasons does not necessarily mean they are equal: I believe that the reasons for
having rules are vastly superior to those against having rules.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REASONS-FOR-RULES">REASONS FOR RULES</h3>
<ol>
   <li>For people who love rules of course but this reason doesn't count.<p>Such as myself.</p></li>
   <li>Convenient balancing.<p>Suppose a joining player is trying to make a balanced character: "Does this look fine to you?" GM: "Did you follow the rules?" player: "Yes" GM: "Then I don't even need to look at it and I know it is balanced (in comparison to the other players)". Another thing is that rules may limit or call attention to certain potent combinations so that a power gamer (aka power player) can't easily break the balance without cheating. This also means that certain combinations that the GM wouldn't notice have already been covered. Of course the GM should still look over the character sheet especially in this game which has a few things that only the GM can balance</p></li>
   <li>Convenient quantitative mechanics.<p>Player 1: "my character has super speed" Player 2: "so does mine except I'm faster" P1: "the heck you are: anything you can do I can do better". Who is faster? Well if you have no quantity to represent speed then there is no way of knowing (most likly they would be deemed the same speed and a race would boil down to a dice roll). But using rules you can instead buy a certain number of ranks which also addresses the question of "exactly how fast am I?"</p></li>
   <li>It's possible to write down and pass around which also allows profit.<p>Obviously it isn't possible to write a book about a game system that doesn't use books but having rules provides something that can be passed around (electronically or otherwise). FYI: I do not intend to make money off of this.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REASONS-AGAINST-RULES">REASONS AGAINST RULES</h3>
<ol>
   <li>For people who hate rules of course but this reason doesn't count.<p>Listed here for the same reason as the first reason of the previous list.</p></li>
   <li>Bringing in new people is easy since there is nothing to read up on.<p>"I've never played this before and I want to join, tell me what I need to know and what I need to do". Instead of handing the player a book and tell them to come back tomorrow, you can sit down and explain everything in what shouldn't take more than an hour.</p></li>
   <li>Easy to remember (or perhaps unnecessary to remember).<p>Player: "I don't remember how we handled navigation at sea last time" GM: "for you roll 1d20 and get at least a 5" There is no need to look up rules on how to handle situations since the GM controls the mechanics.</p></li>
   <li>Unlimited versatility.<p>Player: "since I'm a monkey can I stand on my head and (or sit down) and using these swords attack 4 times in one turn?" GM: "Sure why not... If you use your tail that makes 5 times." Although this example would normally be extremely unbalanced (depending on the situation), it is obviously possible to do anything the GM can imagine (if the GM can't imagine it then the player will have to explain it more).</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="generated-class-8">Metaphysics Rant</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Notice that it is impossible for anyone to alter any meta level above themselves. For example a
person in real life can't alter real life physics because real life physics have authority over them, if he was to
overcome physics by shear willpower then that means he has ascended to a higher meta level, and for this to even be
possible physics would have to allow it unless his willpower was already at a higher meta level. Also note that the
numbering I gave to the meta levels in the table above is arbitrary and meaningless. This table does not have every
possible meta level since numbers below 0 exist, such as if the character plays a game (within a game), and also notice
that the table doesn't include governmental hierarchy (which would exist entirely in level 3) etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters are by default at meta level 0. Characters with the power <b>Reality Warp</b> are at
meta level 1 because they can change Physics and are not controlled by it. Characters with the advantage <b>Beyond
Mortal</b> are somewhere between 0 and 1 since they are unaffected by physics yet can't change them or more accurately
they are meta level 1 but are prevented from changing anything by meta level 3 (the Gamemaster). Characters with the
power <b>Alter Metaphysics</b> are at meta level 2 since they can control the game rules and are not governed by
them.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Players are always at least 1 meta level above their character. Characters have a maximum meta
level of 2 and players have a maximum of 3 (which would also make them a Gamemaster). Although players do have the
ability to control characters other then their own, the Gamemaster does not give them the authority to do so. Each level
must obey (is not able to disobey) every rule of every level above them and each level has control over all levels below
them and some control over the same level. Each meta level must agree for example there can't be a rule that says there
is no gravity and a rule that says there is: one must replace the other.</div>
