<p>You build a hero using a "budget" of <b>Character Points</b>. There are also certain limits and
guidelines imposed by the game's <b>power level</b>, chosen by the Gamemaster, but within those limits you can build a
wide range of characters.</p>
<p>The quickest and easiest way to create your own hero is to look through the various <a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/index.html">
example super heroes</a>, choose one that fits the type of hero you want to play, and customize it to match your ideas. With just
a few quick choices, you have a new hero, complete and ready for the game!</p>
<p>Each hero offers a complete, ready-to-play power level 10 hero, the recommended starting
power level. Some of the <a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/index.html">example super heroes</a> offer
a few simple choices in terms of skills, advantages, or sets of powers to fit
different themes. For example, many heroes offer a choice of an Expertise skill to round out the character's
background and interests outside of superheroism.</p>
<p>Some heroes also offer an <b>Options</b> section, where you can change some of the
preexisting trait choices to create a different kind of hero. For example, the <a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/crime-fighter.html">Crime Fighter</a>
has an option for having a <a href="gadgets-gear/vehicles.html">vehicle</a> instead of 3 <a href="advantages.html">advantages</a>.
Other <a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/index.html">example super heroes</a> offer similar options.</p>
<p>Even if the hero does not have an <b>Options</b> section that does not mean you cannot
customize the character to suit the type of hero you want to play! The examples are just starting points: if you are
more familiar with character design feel free to change any or all of your chosen example's traits. So long as you
stay within the bounds of available Character points, series power level, and your Gamemaster's approval, you're
fine.</p>
<h1>Hero Design</h1>
<p>Designing a hero from scratch follows a series of simple steps. You'll need a copy of the
character sheet found in the back of the book (and also available online) and some scratch paper to design your
character.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-1.-HERO-CONCEPT">1. Hero Concept</h2>
<div class="right-panel">
<div class="red-img-border">
<a href="http://stornart.com/images/artfiles/FirewingLoRes.jpg">
<img src="../images/Firewing.jpg" /></a>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before you get started, consider what sort of hero you want to create. What are the hero's
basic abilities? What are the hero's powers? What's the hero's origin? You may want to take a look at the
<a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/index.html">example super heroes</a> for some ideas of the different types
of heroes you can create. You also can draw inspiration from
your favorite characters from comic books, television, or movies. Take a look through <b>Advantages</b> and see if any
of the powers there inspire a character idea. You may want to jot down a few notes about the sort of hero you'd prefer
to play, which will help guide you through the rest of the character design process.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-2.-GAMEMASTER-GUIDELINES">2. Gamemaster Guidelines</h2>
<p>Your GM may have particular guidelines for characters in the game, such as not allowing certain
powers or concepts or requiring particular descriptors. If there are no aliens in the setting, for example, then you
obviously can't play an alien hero. Likewise, if your Gamemaster bans mental powers from the series, then a psychic
isn't appropriate. Run your hero concept by your Gamemaster before you start working on it! You might also want to
consult with your fellow players so you can design your characters together and ensure they'll make a good team.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-3.-POWER-LEVEL">3. Power Level</h2>
<p>Your GM sets the starting power level for the series. Generally, this is level 10, but it may
range anywhere from level 1 to level 20 or more. The power level determines the player characters' starting Character
points and exactly where you can spend them. The power level is the same for all player characters however it doesn't
apply to non-player characters. Such characters (including <a href="advantages.html#TOC-MINION">Minions</a>,
<a href="advantages.html#TOC-SIDEKICK">Sidekicks</a>, <a href="powers/effects/summon-minion.html">Summon Minion</a>, etc)
have their own power level.</p>
<p>See <b>Power Level</b> for details. If the power level is at least 20 also see <a
href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-GODHOOD">Transcendence</a> in the Gamemaster section.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-4.-ABILITIES">4. Abilities</h2>
<p>Choose the ability ranks you want your character to have and pay 2 Character points for each
rank. Choose defense bonuses for your character, paying 1 Character points per +1 defense over the base rank provided by
your hero's abilities. To improve your hero's Toughness, see <a href="advantages.html">Advantages</a> and <a
href="powers/index.html">Power</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="abilities.html">Abilities</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-5.-SKILLS">5. Skills</h2>
<p>Choose the skill ranks you want your character to have and pay 1 Character point per 2 total skill
ranks.</p>
<p>See <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-6.-ADVANTAGES">6. Advantages</h2>
<p>Choose the advantages you want your character to have and pay 1 Character point per advantage
or rank in an advantage.</p>
<p>See <a href="advantages.html">Advantages</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-7.-POWERS">7. Powers</h2>
<p>Create your hero's powers by choosing their desired effects and paying the effects' base cost,
adjusted for any modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks.</p>
<p>See <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-8.-COMPLICATIONS">8. Complications</h2>
<p>Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can have more, if you want, and the more
complications your hero faces, the greater your chances for earning victory points during the game.</p>
<p>See <b>Complications</b> for details.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-9.-DETAILS">9. Details</h2>
<p>Go through the limits listed under <b>Power Level</b> and make sure your hero's traits all fit
within them. If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.</p>
<p>Go back through and add up the costs of your hero's abilities, defenses, skills, advantages,
and powers. You should end up with a figure equal to the starting Character points shown on <b>Table: Starting
Character Points</b>. If not, double-check your math and either remove or add traits to your character to reach the
starting Character point total. You are not required to spend all of your character (or equipment) points.</p>
<p>Figure out things like your hero's name, appearance, origin, background, and motivation. If you
can, consider creating a sketch or detailed description of your hero's costume.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-10.-GAMEMASTER-APPROVAL">10. Gamemaster Approval</h2>
<p>Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The GM should check again to make sure your
Character points are spent and added up correctly, your hero follows the power level guidelines and any other guidelines
set for the series, and that the character is generally complete and suited to the overall game. Once your GM has
approved, your new hero is ready for play!</p>
<h1 id="TOC-CHARACTER-POINTS">Character Points</h1>
<p>You design a hero by spending <b>Character Points</b> on various traits. Each ability, skill,
advantage, power, and other trait has an associated Character point cost.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STARTING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Starting Character Points</h2>
<p>The game's power level provides a guideline for how many Character points you get initially to
design your character, as shown on the <b>Starting Character points</b> table (Character points = power level x 15).
The Gamemaster can vary the starting Character points as desired to suit the series.</p>
<p>The minimum power level (for everyone) is 1 and there is no maximum. The minimum starting character points for
player characters is 15. NPCs have a minimum of 0 character points. There is no maximum number of character points.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-SPENDING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Spending Character Points</h2>
<p>Each trait costs a certain number of Character points. You "spend" or allocate your points to
give your character different traits. Once spent, Character points cannot be reallocated without the use of a particular

<h2 id="TOC-GAINING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Gaining Character Points</h2>
<p>The Gamemaster awards heroes Character points over the course of a series. This represents the
experience and confidence the heroes have gained, along with other factors contributing to an increase in their
abilities, skills, and powers. The Gamemaster decides when and how often to award character points
at his discretion (see <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-AWARDING-CHARACTER-POINTS">awarding character points</a>).</p>
<p>Players can spend their heroes' awarded Character points in-between adventures to improve the heroes'
traits, limited only by the series power level. You can also choose to save up unspent Character points, waiting until
the <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-INCREASING-POWER-LEVEL">power level increases</a>, in order to spend them
to improve a trait already at its maximum rank.
Players spend Character points on new or improved traits for their heroes just the same as spending them to create
a hero. So if your hero has a power costing 2 points per rank, and you want to improve it by 1 rank, spend 2 of your
earned Character points to do so.</p>
<p>Just like starting Character points, once earned Character points have been allocated to a
trait, they remain that way, unless some effect causes the character's point allocation to
change. See <a href="#TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Reallocating Character points</a>
for more information. <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a> can cause a temporary loss of points
but once the effect wears off the character points return exactly as they were before.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Reallocating Character Points</h2>
<p>Normally a hero's traits are fixed. Once Character points are spent on them, they remain there.
In some cases, however, the Gamemaster may allow players to reallocate their characters' points, changing their traits
within <a href="#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">the limits of the series power level</a>, perhaps even losing some traits
and gaining entirely new ones. This is
typically a result of encountering a transformational effect
(intense radiation, mutagenic chemicals, cosmic power sources, and so forth). It's up to the GM when these
character-altering events occur, but they should be fairly rare unless their effects are intended to be temporary
complications or the player requested it.</p>
<p>In order to have fun it's important to play a character you enjoy so you may ask for a point
reallocation to correct mistakes. However such reallocations should be within reasonable limits. If you want to change
everything about your character it would be better explained that this is a different person. Additionally you should not
be able to change powers every single adventure, for that see <a href="powers/effects/variable.html">Variable</a>.</p>
<p>Note that when an <a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> is changed <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> and
<a href="defenses.html#TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">Defenses</a> are affected.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CHARACTER-POINTS-OF-NON-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Character Points of Non-player Characters</h2>
<p>While the GM should keep the power level guidelines and suggested starting Character points of
the series in mind while creating villains and members of the supporting cast, non-player non-combatant characters
do not need to be so carefully tracked simply build with as many Character points as the GM wants to give them.
In other words, there
is no need to add up the "cost" of a non-player character. Just assign the appropriate traits at the desired
ranks. The Character point total may also be less than the recommended
starting Character points for that power level, especially for animals which frequently have unspent points.</p>
<p>This is done to simplify some work of the Gamemaster: if it doesn't need an exact number then don't bother counting it.
Some NPCs don't need a character sheet beyond concept and name.</p>
<h1 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL">Power Level</h1>
<div class="right-panel green-panel">
<h3>Power Levels</h3>
<div>
<p>Heroes cover a diverse range of power levels, from the first costumed adventurers of the Golden
Age, who relied solely on their skills and a few gimmicks (and modern vigilantes of the mean streets, who do much the
same), to the greatest protectors of the world, who take on cosmic threats on a regular basis. The following are some
common power levels and starting Character point values suitable for different games:</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL-8---MASKED-ADVENTURERS">Power Level 8 - Masked Adventurers</h3>
<p>This power level fits the "Mystery Men" era of the Golden Age of comic books, as well as for
teams of mostly non-powered adventurers: heroes who rely more on their skills and wits (and maybe a few gadgets) rather
than amazing powers. The suggested starting value of 120 Character points creates well-rounded heroes at this level,
particularly if the emphasis is on skills and advantages--and maybe a power or two--rather than a lot of powers. A
higher starting Character point total allows for more diverse capabilities within the same limits.</p>
<p>Heroes at this level often focus more on skill than sheer damage output, often having fighting
skills in the 10-12 range, but commensurately lower damage and effect ranks (using just their fists or small
arms).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL-10---SUPER-HEROES">Power Level 10 - Super Heroes</h3>
<p>The suggested starting power level suits mature and experienced "adventurers" of the previous
level along with a wide range of younger or focused superhumans.</p>
<p>Power level 10 heroes may have a balance of attack and effect, passive and active defense, or may
go for being stronger on one side than the other, having great combat skill, but comparatively limited damage, for
example, or great Toughness, but lower active defenses.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL-12---BIG-LEAGUES">Power Level 12 - Big Leagues</h3>
<p>Power level 12 is where you find many of the more experienced and powerful heroes. They are
"senior" heroes, usually with considerable capabilities (and, often, experience). Those lacking superhuman powers have
amazing levels of skill and resources to draw upon while the superhuman types are often among the most capable in their
particular area, often worthy of titles like "King" and "World's Greatest".</p>
<p>In areas where power level 12 heroes tip the balance of their combat capabilities, they can
have amazing ranks in attack or defense.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL-14---WORLD-PROTECTORS">Power Level 14 - World-protectors</h3>
<p>Heroes at this level are among the most powerful beings of the universe. They are largely
capable of ignoring lesser concerns and tend to focus on "big picture" problems like alien invasions and
world-conquerors along with natural disasters (although they may still handle some of the "small stuff" as well).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Power level</b> is an overall measure of effectiveness and power, primarily combat ability,
but also generally what sort of tasks a character can be expected to accomplish on a routine basis (see <b>Routine
Checks</b> in <a href="../gameplay/the-basics.html">The Basics</a>).</p>
<p>The minimum power level (for everyone) is 1 and there is no maximum.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">Power Level Limitations</h2>
<p>Power level is a value set by the Gamemaster for the players. It places certain
limits on where and how players can spend Character points when creating or improving their heroes. <a href="advantages.html">Advantages</a> and all
modifiers (including circumstance) are included when determining power level limitations. Power level imposes the following limits:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> Rank</b>: Your hero's <a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> rank (including those from
<a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>) cannot exceed the series power level +10.
This is the same as most skills (see below).</li>
<li><b>Combat Skill Modifier</b>: Your hero's total modifier (<a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html">advantage</a> modifiers, etc)
of both <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> and
<a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged Combat</a>
cannot exceed the series power level. This is the same as the attack limit (see below).</li>
<li><b>Every other Skill Modifier</b>: Your hero's total modifier (<a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html">advantage</a> modifiers, etc)
with any skill except <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> and
<a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged Combat</a> (see above)
cannot exceed the series power level +10. This includes untrained skill modifiers using
only ability rank, and so sets an effective limit on all abilities since each is associated with at least 1 skill (see above).</li>
<li><b>Attack Modifier</b>: Your hero's total attack bonus (from <a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html">advantage</a> modifiers,
<a href="powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-ACCURATE">accurate</a> extra ranks, etc)
cannot exceed the series power level.</li>
<li><b>Effect rank of an Attack</b>: Your hero's effect rank of an attack <a href="powers/effects/index.html">power</a>
cannot exceed the series power level.</li>
<li><b>Defense Modifier</b>: Each of your hero's defenses cannot have a total that exceeds the series power level.
This includes <a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="powers/effects/protection.html">protection</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html#TOC-DEFENSIVE-ROLL">defensive roll</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that power level limitations are global so that if for any reason a number total would exceed
the maximum then it is instead reduced to the maximum permitted. Power level limitations can't be trumped by other rules,
however since power level is character specific, two allies may have different capabilities. One reason power level limitations
are like this is to prevent an <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a> that
<a href="powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AFFECTS-OTHERS">Affects Others</a> from making someone more powerful than
the player's normal limits (power level can't be increased by any effect).</p>

<h2 id="TOC-WEAK-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Weak Player Characters</h2>
<p>The GM may want to keep an eye out for very low toughness or attack.
For the most part, these designs are self-limiting, but they can pose problems in comparison to better-balanced characters.
A player might not know how useless an effect with low attack is until later. A player be thinking
"it'll be rare but when it hits: you better watch out" then after several battles without landing a single attack
will regret the idea. That would be a good time to allow point reallocation but you can save time by watching out
for it when initially making a character.</p>
<p>Unusually low toughness, on the other hand, is a different gamble.
A player may think "I'll be a regular human with great equipment" wanting to be the underdog or Batman or something.
But if his friends all have high toughness and they all fight against a villain with high damage...
No one wants the character they made to die in a single hit and it might be hard for a GM to manage fights
with people with very different combat abilities. Don't put too much faith into Parry/Dodge because: there's
always a 4% change you'll fail, Perception range always hits, and the conditions Vulnerable and Defenseless
(which can be caused by a surprise round or other circumstances) lower/eliminate active defenses.
And don't put too much faith in staying out of range: the villain might have Perception range effects or other tricks.
Admittedly some of these things wouldn't happen accidentally but everyone probably wants to be able to participate in the battle
and not "we'll handle this while you sit in the corner for the next few minutes" (which is also the problem with low
attack, low damage, and an unbalanced team in general).</p>
<p>How little is too little? The problem is about inconsistency and not about specific numbers.
If the entire team has Toughness 5 then challenges can be made accordingly even if that's well below the maximum for the
power level. A human with skills, advantages, and equipment can help out his superpowered friends but if his friends are
too strong they'll be out of his league in combat. He might end up being utility only: "you handle skill checks and we'll do
everything else" which can still be fun in certain circumstances as long as everyone has realistic expectations.
When Batman and Superman team up against Darkseid (all 3 from DC Comics) Batman can't fight Darkseid so he does something
else instead such as hack into Darkseid's base.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>A lot of background details go into making your hero more than just a collection of numbers.
Take a moment (if you haven't already) to consider some of the following things about your character. Note that Real
Name is the only required information, the rest does not need to be written down as long as you know how to play as your
character and the Gamemaster allows it.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-NAME">Name</h2>
<p>What is your character's name? That is to say, what is the name the hero uses in public, that
appears in one-inch type in the newspaper headlines? Most heroes adopt unique and distinctive "code names," so consider
a suitable name for yours. Code names are often based on powers, theme, or style. Here are some options to
consider:</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ORIGIN">Origin</h2>
<p>A name may be based on the hero's origin, power source, nation (or even world) of birth, and
such.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-POWERS">Powers</h2>
<p>Choose a name based on the hero's powers: Firestarter or Blaze for a flame-controlling
character, Thunder or Spark for an electrical character, and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-THEME">Theme</h2>
<p>Maybe the character has a theme or style suggesting a name: Paladin might be a medieval knight
displaced into the present day, with a magical sword and armor. Madame Macabre may be all about magic and the
occult.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-TITLES">Titles</h2>
<p>Names may include various titles like Mister, Miss, Ms., Doctor, Sir, Lord, Lady, and Madam or
even royal titles like King, Queen, Prince, Princess, Duke, Baron, Emperor and so forth. Military ranks are also popular
parts of hero names, especially General, Major, and Captain.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-GENDER">Gender</h2>
<p>Names often include gender designations like Man/Woman, Boy/Girl, Lad/Lass, and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SOUND">Sound</h2>
<p>Some code-names don't really have anything to do with a character's powers or background--they
just sound cool: Kismet, Scion, Animus, Damask, and so forth. They may hint at the hero's powers or origin, or have
nothing to do with them.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-REAL-NAME">Real Name</h2>
<p>Some heroes go by their given name, not using a code-name at all. Oftentimes these names still
sound like codenames, however. They may also be nicknames, such as "Dash" for someone with the name Dashell, or "Buzz"
for someone with the name Buzcinski, or whatever other nickname a character may have, such as "Stretch" or "Tiny".</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ORIGIN1">Origin</h2>
<p>What's the origin of your hero's powers? It can be anything from a character born with the
potential for powers to someone granted them by an accident--exposure to a strange meteor, radiation, genetic
engineering, or any of countless similar encounters. Here are some of the more common superhero origins:</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ACCIDENT">Accident</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most common origin. The hero gains powers accidentally from exposure to some force
like radiation, chemicals, unleashed mystic energies, being struck by lightning, and so forth. Accidents are often
one-time events, although sometimes there is an effort to recreate an accident to deliberately make super-beings. The
current science of the setting tends to influence accidental origins. Golden Age heroes in the 1940s often gained their
powers from chemical accidents while Silver Age heroes in the Atomic Age of the '60s got their powers from radiation and
modern heroes acquire powers from accidents involving genetic engineering, nanotech, and similar cutting-edge
technologies.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ALIEN">Alien</h3>
<p>A hero may be a member of an alien race with unusual powers compared to humans. Either all
members of the race have similar powers or particular conditions (lighter gravity, solar radiation, etc.) grant them
powers while on Earth. Some "alien" races in the comics are actually super-human offshoots of humanity living isolated
from the rest of the world. "Aliens" also include mystical beings from other dimensions, from angels and demons to
elementals and actual gods, as well as mortal half-breeds descended from them. An alien hero's powers might even have
another origin; being an alien only explains part of the character's powers or is merely a background element.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ENDOWMENT">Endowment</h3>
<p>Some outside force grants the hero powers. This might be an experimental procedure, a godlike
higher power, a secret organization that hands out powerful devices, a mysterious wizard, or something similar. The
patron might expect something in return from the hero for this boon, or the gift could be unconditional.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-EXPERIMENT">Experiment</h3>
<p>Some heroes gain powers from a deliberate effort, such as a scientific or mystical technique
for transforming someone into a super-being. Like accidents, experiments are often impossible to duplicate. The hero may
be a willing volunteer or a victim chosen to test out the technique. Some heroes create their own powers, either
developing the power-granting procedure or building their own devices.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MUTANT">Mutant</h3>
<p>A hero may simply be born "different," with the genetic potential for super-powers. These
latent powers typically emerge in a time of stress, especially the changes brought on by puberty, although they might
also appear as a result of an accident (combining the accident and mutant origins).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TRAINING">Training</h3>
<p>Finally, some heroes acquire powers through hard work and training, whether physical
discipline, studying esoteric martial arts techniques, meditation and introspection to unlock hidden mental powers, or
mastering the arts of magic. Such training is typically arduous and not everyone has what it takes to accomplish it.
Heroes who gained their powers through training may have rivals or foes who trained with them (see Enemy and Rivalry
complications).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ORIGINS-AS-DESCRIPTORS">Origins As Descriptors</h3>
<p>Origins can serve as descriptors for a character's powers (see <b>Descriptors</b> in <a
href="powers/index.html">Powers</a>). For example, a super-powered mutant has the "mutant" descriptor, meaning the character
may be detected by mutant-detection powers, affected by mutant-specific devices, and so forth. The same is true for a
mystic, an alien, or any other origin.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ORIGIN-GUIDELINES">Origin Guidelines</h3>
<p>Your GM may decide to limit the origins for the series you're playing for story reasons. The
Gamemaster may set specific guidelines, ranging from restricting certain types of origins (no aliens or no mystics, for
example) to requiring all heroes share a common type of origin, such as everyone is a mutant or the result of a unique
accident. Consult with your GM before you choose a particular origin for your hero.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AGE">Age</h2>
<p>How old is the character? Superheroes tend to hover in that indeterminate age between 20 and
40, but some heroes are younger, often teenagers, and some are older, possibly much older, depending on a hero's
background. For example, the hero might have fought in World War II but ended up in the present day due to time travel
or suspended animation. Heroes with Immunity to Aging are effectively immortal--they might be thousands of years
old.</p>
<p>Consider the effects of age on your hero. Someone who fought in the Second World War is likely
to have a different worldview than a modern teenager who just acquired super-powers, to say nothing of an immortal who
has seen civilizations rise and fall or a godlike being from the dawn of time. A character's age may influence the
choice of certain traits. Aged characters are likely to have lower physical ability ranks, for example, while younger
ones may have fewer skill ranks (having had less time to train in various skills).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-APPEARANCE">Appearance</h2>
<p>What does your hero look like? Consider things like the character's race, sex, ethnicity, and
other factors in appearance. Is the hero even human? Superheroes can be aliens, robots, androids, spirits, and beings of
pure energy. Is the character short or tall? What about hair and eye color? Does the hero have any distinguishing marks
or unique features; is his appearance unusual in any way (apart from running around in a costume, that is)? Does the
hero qualify for the Attractive advantage? (See <a href="advantages.html">Advantages</a> for details.) What about
complications stemming from the hero's looks?</p>
<h2 id="TOC-COSTUME">Costume</h2>
<p>A costume is a big part of a superhero's appearance. Like code names, most heroes have a
distinctive costume, usually something skin-tight and colorful, often emblazoned with a symbol or logo. Other heroes
wear more military-style outfits, fatigues or body armor with numerous bandoleers and belts. A suit of armor may serve
as the hero's costume: anything from ancient mail to a high-tech battlesuit. A few heroes don't wear a special costume,
just ordinary street clothes (which in itself can be pretty distinctive among a group of spandex-clad heroes).</p>
<p>In the comics, costumes are generally immune to the kind of routine wear-and-tear a hero's
powers should inflict on them. For example, heroes who can burst into flames don't usually incinerate their clothing.
The same is true for heroes who change their size or shape. Although a hero's costume can be damaged or torn by attacks
and other circumstances, it's usually immune to the hero's powers. This doesn't cost any points; it's just the way
costumes work.</p>
<p>For more on costumes as equipment, see <a href="gadgets-gear/index.html">Gadgets &amp;
Gear</a>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ALTERNATE-IDENTITY">Alternate Identity</h2>
<p>Although heroes spend a lot of time fighting crime and using their powers to help others, most
also try to find time to have lives of their own. Consider the hero's "normal" life, both before acquiring super-powers
and since. Does the hero maintain a secret identity, hiding behind a mask or other guise in order to have a semblance of
a normal life while "off duty"? Describe the hero's other identity and what the hero does while not out fighting the
forces of evil.</p>
<p>Other heroes abandon all pretense of a "civilian" identity, revealing their true names to the
world and living in the public eye. This means no juggling two separate lives, but also no refuge from the media,
adoring fans, or the hero's enemies, who can all keep track of the hero more easily. Both approaches have their good and
bad points. Consider which is best for your hero.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PERSONALITY">Personality</h2>
<p>How would you describe your hero's personality? While heroes tend to share a desire to use
their powers for good and uphold the law, they also show a diverse range of attitudes. One hero may be dedicated to the
ideals of truth, justice, and equality while another is a vigilante willing to break the law in order to ensure justice
is done. Some heroes are forthright and cheerful while others are grim and unrelenting. Consider your hero's attitudes
and personality traits. Don't overlook the effect of Motivation on your hero's personality and vice versa (see
<b>Motivation</b>, previously).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-GOALS">Goals</h2>
<p>Finally, what are your hero's goals? All heroes want things like peace and justice to one
degree or another, but what other things does your hero want? One hero may want to find his long-lost family while
another may want to avenge a terrible wrong done to her in the past. A monstrous or alien hero may seek acceptance and a
new home on Earth, while a teen hero may want to live up to the legacy of a mentor or predecessor. Giving your hero a
goal beyond simply "doing good" can help give the character more depth and provide opportunities for roleplaying and
complications during the game. Don't overlook it.</p>
