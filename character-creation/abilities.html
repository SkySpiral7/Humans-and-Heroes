<h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Everyone has certain basic <b>abilities</b>: how strong, fast, smart, and clever they are.
These abilities influence most things your character does. Stronger characters can lift greater weights, more agile
characters have better balance, tougher characters can soak up more damage, and so forth.</p>
<p>All characters have eight basic abilities: <a href="#TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength (Str)</a>,
<a href="#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility (Agl)</a>, <a href="#TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">Fighting (Fgt)</a>,
<a href="#TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">Dexterity (Dex)</a>, <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina (Sta)</a>,
<a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect (Int)</a>, <a href="#TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">Awareness (Awe)</a>,
and <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence (Pre)</a>.
<a href="#TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength</a>, <a href="#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility</a>,
<a href="#TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">Fighting</a>, <a href="#TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">Dexterity</a>,
and <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a>
are <b>physical abilities</b>, whereas <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a>,
<a href="#TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">Awareness</a>, and <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a> are <b>mental abilities</b>. Each
above-average ability provides a bonus on certain dice rolls; while below average abilities apply a penalty.</p>
<h1>Ability Ranks</h1>
<p>Each ability has a <b>rank</b> associated with it, based on how above or below average it is.
Abilities start at rank 0, the baseline average for an adult human being. Abilities can't go below -5 but, aside from
<a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>, there is no upper limit.</p>
<p>The ability rank is added to, or subtracted from, the sum of a dice roll when your character
does something related to that ability. For example, your <a href="#TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength</a> rank affects the
amount of damage you do when
punching someone. Your <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a> rank comes into play when you roll skills based on
<a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a>, and so forth. Sometimes
your rank is used to calculate another value, such as when you use your <a href="#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility</a> to
determine how good you are at avoiding harm with your reflexes (your Dodge defense).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-BUYING-ABILITY-RANKS">Buying Ability Ranks</h2>
<p>You choose your hero's ability ranks by spending character points on them. Increasing an
ability rank by 1 costs 2 character points, so putting 4 points into <a href="#TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">Dexterity</a>, for
example, raises it from 0 to 2. Remember a rank of 0 is average (See <b>Table: Ability Benchmarks</b>.)</p>
<p>It may be desirable to acquire ability ranks (some or all of them) via <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>
for thematic or mechanical reasons (see <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a> for explanation of both).
Note that ability ranks above 3 do not require <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>, this
contradiction is a snafu due to the DCs of <a href="skills.html">skills</a> (this difficult fix is being worked on).</p>

<h3>Beyond Human</h3>
<div>
<p>Note that a rank of 3 is defined as "the peak of human achievement" in the description on <b>Table:
Ability Benchmarks</b>. A character with an ability rank greater than 3 isn't necessarily "non-human," merely superhuman
in comparison to ordinary people. Such a character isn't outside of the realm of physics just a human with unnatural talent
and skill beyond training. For a character that is strictly within human limitations read the warning in
<a href="index.html#TOC-WEAK-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Weak player characters</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="TOC-REDUCING-ABILITIES">Reducing Abilities</h2>
<p>You can also lower one or more of your character's ability ranks from the starting value of 0.
Each rank you lower an ability gives you an additional 2 character points to spend elsewhere. You cannot lower an
ability rank below -5, which is itself a serious deficiency.</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Ability Cost = 2 character points per +1 to an ability rank.</span>
<span class="generated-class-2">Gain 2 bonus character points per -1 to an ability rank.</span>
<p>Note that negative ability ranks is the only place in the game that gives back character points.
Also see <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html">Flaws</a> which reduce costs but never give back character points.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DEBILITATED-ABILITIES">Debilitated Abilities</h2>
<p>If one of your hero's ability ranks becomes -5 for any reason (eg <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a>),
that ability is said to be <b>debilitated</b> and you suffer more serious effects than just a penalty. You automatically
fail any rolls related to that ability including attacks and defense checks (except <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Debilitated Stamina</a>).
Ability ranks
cannot be lowered any further once they are debilitated (ie -5 is the minimum). When making a character abilities can be
lowered to -5 to gain 10 character points but doing so it not a good idea (see each ability below).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ABSENT-ABILITIES">Absent Abilities</h2>
<p>Player characters are not allowed to have <b>absent abilities</b> (see <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity
to fatigue</a> instead). <b>Absent abilities</b> exist to handle very unusual NPCs. Even then it is not possible to have <b>absent</b>
<a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a>, <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a>, or <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than having a rank of -5 in a given ability, some characters actually lack an ability altogether. This gives
back 10 character points (same as debilitated) and has the same effect as debilitated except more extreme where possible.
The ability is considered to be rank -&infin; and therefore can't be raised by <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>
(or lowered by <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a>).</p>
<p><b>Absent abilities</b> should be rare as it creates an unusual character with a serious disability. If you (as a Gamemaster
since players are not allowed to have <b>absent abilities</b>) are making a character with multiple <b>absent abilities</b> consider
if this should be a character at all. It may be better handled as an object, obstacle, circumstance, etc even if it has
<a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a> and the ability to die. Note that everything has
<a href="defenses.html#TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</a> (even inanimate
objects) and with enough <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a> can be destroyed. Plants and machines
can have other traits (such as <a href="defenses.html#TOC-FORTITUDE">Fortitude</a>) and need not be characters.</p>
<p>The minimum requirement to be considered a character (and not an object with traits) is to have HP (must have
<a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">stamina</a>) and be able to take actions (which requires both <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">intellect</a>
and <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a>). Although <a href="#TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">Awareness</a> isn't required it would
be difficult to make use of a character which is permanently unaware to everything, such a character would need
<a href="powers/effects/communication.html">Communication</a> or something in order to get feedback for any action taken
(otherwise it would have no idea that it even has the ability to take said actions). Some traits (mostly
<a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a> and <a href="skills.html">skills</a>) make a distinction between characters
and objects. However some actions only require certain traits to be present on the target and thus an action that
normally works on characters could be done on an object with the necessary traits.
If it is unclear whether a certain action can be taken on a target ask you Gamemaster.</p>
<p><b>Absent</b> <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">stamina</a> is not allowed (even for NPCs) as that would require
being dead. Even <a href="../examples/characters/constructs/zombie.html">zombies</a> and <a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/construct.html">robots</a>
(both of which are considered alive by game mechanics) have <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">stamina</a> and in fact likely
have infinite <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">stamina</a> for which
see <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity to fatigue</a>.
Things without <a href="#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">stamina</a> would not be considered characters and do not have
<a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-HEALTH-POINTS">HP</a>
(see <a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-DAMAGING-OBJECTS">object damage</a> instead).</p>
<p><b>Absent</b> <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">intellect</a> is not allowed (even for NPCs) because being unable to
think means being unable to take actions. Objects without <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">intellect</a> (such as a tree or statue) are immune to
<a href="powers/effects/mind-reading.html">Mind Reading</a> since there's no thoughts to be read.
Likewise <b>absent</b> <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">intellect</a> things are immune to
<a href="skills.html#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a>, <a href="../examples/powers/mind-control.html">mind control</a>,
etc since they have no mind to influence.</p>
<p><b>Absent</b> <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a> is not allowed (even for NPCs) because being unable to
decide to do anything (even choosing to follow commands) means being unable to take actions.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SUPER-STRENGTH-AND-SPEED">Super Strength And Speed</h2>
<p>Super strength and super speed are common super powers. The obvious way to do this is put many
ranks into <a href="#TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength</a> and <a href="#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility</a> but this isn't a direct
equivalent. For super strength buy things like <a href="../examples/powers/power-lifting.html">Power Lifting</a>,
<a href="powers/effects/leaping.html">Leaping</a>, and <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>
(<a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Strength-based</a>). For super speed buy things like <a href="advantages.html#TOC-IMPROVED-INITIATIVE">Improved Initiative</a>
(likely as an <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>), <a href="powers/effects/quickness.html">Quickness</a>,
and <a href="powers/effects/movement.html#TOC-GROUND-SPEED">Ground Speed</a>.
For your convenience there are example power packages for <a
href="../examples/powers/super-strength.html">Super-Strength</a> and <a
href="../examples/powers/super-speed.html">Super-Speed</a> see them for details.</p>
<h1>The Abilities</h1>
<p>Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength (Str)</h2>
<p><b>Strength</b> measures sheer muscle power and the ability to apply it. It gives you the ability to
move anything that is physical.</p>
<p>Your <b>Strength</b> rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Strength-based</a>
<a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a> such as unarmed attacks.</li>
<li>How far you can jump (based on an <a href="skills.html#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a> skill check).</li>
<li>The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a> skill checks.</li>
<li><b>Strength</b> checks for other feats of strength when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you must drop everything that you are carrying or holding (not clothing). Fall prone if
you are unable to do so. You automatically fail any roll involving <b>Strength</b> and can't use
<a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Strength-based</a> <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>
at all.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility (Agl)</h2>
<p><b>Agility</b> is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coordination. It gives you the ability to move.</p>
<p>Your <b>Agility</b> rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dodge defense, for avoiding <a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">ranged attacks</a> and other hazards.</li>
<li>Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-ACROBATICS">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="skills.html#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> skill checks.</li>
<li><b>Agility</b> checks for feats of coordination, gross movement, and quickness when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you are immobilized. You automatically fail any roll involving <b>Agility</b>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">Fighting (Fgt)</h2>
<p><b>Fighting</b> measures your character's ability in close combat, from hitting a target to ducking
and weaving around any counter-attacks. It gives you the ability to manipulate your own body.</p>
<p>Your <b>Fighting</b> rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Attack checks</a> for close attacks.</li>
<li>Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.</li>
<li>There are no other uses. General checks should use <a href="#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility</a> instead of <b>Fighting</b>
(see <a href="../meta/known-issues.html">known snafu</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: nothing special (always fail <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> and
Parry defense).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">Dexterity (Dex)</h2>
<p><b>Dexterity</b> is a measure of hand-eye coordination, precision, and manual dexterity. It gives you the ability to manipulate
objects.</p>
<p>Your <b>Dexterity</b> rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged attack checks</a>.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a> and <a href="skills.html#TOC-VEHICLES">Vehicles</a> skill checks.</li>
<li><b>Dexterity</b> checks for feats of fine control and precision when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you drop everything you are holding, can't use fingers or other
fine motor skills. <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat: Unarmed</a> deals 1 less
<a href="powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a>. You automatically fail any roll involving <b>Dexterity</b>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina (Sta)</h2>
<p><b>Stamina</b> is health, endurance, and overall physical resilience. <b>Stamina</b> is important because it
affects a character's ability to resist most forms of damage.</p>
<p>Your <b>Stamina</b> modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toughness defense, for resisting <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>.</li>
<li>Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your character's health.</li>
<li>Determining length of time before a Fortitude check needs to be made in cases like <a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-FORCED-LABOR">forced labor</a>
and <a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">suffocation</a>.</li>
<li>Note that there are no <a href="skills.html">skills</a> that use <b>Stamina</b> by default but some skills may use it in
some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: when <b>Stamina</b> drops to -5 you become dying (your HP becomes -1 if not already negative)
and can't stabilize until your <b>Stamina</b> is at least -4. Unlike other debilitated abilities you do not automatically fail
defense checks that use <b>Stamina</b> (Fortitude and Toughness) instead you can make the check as though you had -5 <b>Stamina</b>
(you aren't able to make any ability or skill checks due to being incapacitated).</p>
<p><a href="#TOC-ABSENT-ABILITIES">Absent</a> <b>stamina</b> is not allowed (even for NPCs) as that would require
being dead. Even <a href="../examples/characters/constructs/zombie.html">zombies</a> and <a href="../examples/characters/super-heroes/construct.html">robots</a>
(both of which are considered alive by game mechanics) have <b>stamina</b> and in fact likely have infinite <b>stamina</b> for which
see <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity to fatigue</a>.
Things without <b>stamina</b> would not be considered characters and do not have
<a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-HEALTH-POINTS">HP</a>
(see <a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-DAMAGING-OBJECTS">object damage</a> instead).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect (Int)</h2>
<p><b>Intellect</b> covers reasoning ability, learning, memory and knowledge. A character with a high
<b>Intellect</b> rank tends to be knowledgeable and well-educated.</p>
<p>Characters with low <b>intellect</b> don't have specific restrictions an what skills can
be used etc. What characters are capable of understanding is based on Gamemaster discretion and the
<a href="#TOC-TABLE-ABILITY-RANK-BENCHMARKS-EXCLUDING-DICE-">ability example table</a> above. A character with an
<b>intellect</b> of -3 (Toddler level) is only going to be able to understand very basic
<a href="skills.html#TOC-PERSUASION">persuasion</a>, for example, and be unaffected by complex arguments.</p>
<p>Animals should have an <b>intellect</b> from -5 to -3 and have no language (only able to
communicate basic ideas). Those that are almost pure instinct
and reaction (such as insects) have -5 <b>intellect</b>. Most animals have -4 <b>intellect</b>
being able to learn some basic things. Some very smart animals can understand the basics of language (but not communicate)
and perform simple problem solving comparable to a human toddler, these animals would have -3 <b>intellect</b>.</p>
<p>While animals have no language this is not a result of low <b>intellect</b>. For example humans can learn baby
sign language as young as 6 months old which would be a toddler with -4 <b>intellect</b>. Likewise if a character's
<b>intellect</b> is lowered to -5 by <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">weaken</a> he won't lose his languages.</p>
<p>Your <b>Intellect</b> modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-COMMON-KNOWLEDGE">Common Knowledge</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-EXPERTISE">Expertise</a>,
<a href="skills.html#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a>,
<a href="skills.html#TOC-MEMORY">Memory</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-STRATEGY">Strategy</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-TECHNOLOGY">Technology</a>,
and <a href="skills.html#TOC-TREATMENT">Treatment</a> skill checks.</li>
<li><b>Intellect</b> checks to solve problems using sheer brain-power when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you have no knowledge or memory beyond surface thoughts: the instant something is not
being thought about it is forgotten. You don't know who anyone is, what you are doing or why but some complications will
subconsciously remain influencing your actions. You are considered untrained in all skills (due to being unable to remember
training) and some advantages may be unavailable. Since you don't know what to do and why your actions are limited to
immediately obvious reactions to the situation. You automatically fail any roll involving <b>Intellect</b>.
It is still possible for an <b>Intellect</b> debilitated subject to be affected by <a href="powers/effects/mind-reading.html">Mind Reading</a>.
The debilitated subject can only access his/her own surface thoughts and have no access to anything deeper such as memories.
All of this mental information still exists and <a href="powers/effects/mind-reading.html">Mind Reading</a> can view any
layer normally even though the subject can't access them.</p>
<p><a href="#TOC-ABSENT-ABILITIES">Absent</a> <b>intellect</b> is not allowed (even for NPCs) because being unable to
think means being unable to take actions. Objects without <b>intellect</b> (such as a tree or statue) are immune to
<a href="powers/effects/mind-reading.html">Mind Reading</a> since there's no thoughts to be read.
Likewise <a href="#TOC-ABSENT-ABILITIES">absent</a> <b>intellect</b> things are immune to
<a href="skills.html#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a>, <a href="../examples/powers/mind-control.html">mind control</a>,
etc since they have no mind to influence.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">Awareness (Awe)</h2>
<p><b>Awareness</b> covers wisdom, intuition, discernment, and perception. In contrast with <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a>
which covers logic, facts,
quantitative observations, objectivity, and hard science; <b>Awareness</b> covers feelings, opinions, qualitative observations,
subjectivity, and soft science. <b>Awareness</b> covers the understanding part of social interactions, the rest being covered
by <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a>. Simply put <b>Awareness</b> is your ability to sense what is going on.</p>
<p>A character with a high <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a> and a low <b>Awareness</b> may be an "absentminded
professor" type,
smart but not always aware of what's going on. On the other hand, a not so bright (low <a href="#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a>)
character may have
great deal of common sense (high <b>Awareness</b>).</p>
<p>A character with a low <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a> and a high <b>Awareness</b> may understand the social
nuances but be unable to sway people
in his favor. A character with a high <a href="#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a> and a low <b>Awareness</b> may have natural
charisma and a silver tongue but may
be too self-focused to notice others.</p>
<p>Your <b>Awareness</b> modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, and <a href="skills.html#TOC-TRACKING">Tracking</a>
skill checks.</li>
<li><b>Awareness</b> checks to resolve matters of intuition when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you are unaware (all senses). None of your senses works and therefore you are immune to
interaction skills. You may still act although difficult since you are blind, deaf, and numb (everything has total
concealment from you). You automatically fail any roll involving <b>Awareness</b>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence (Pre)</h2>
<p><b>Presence</b> is force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability. <b>Presence</b> is useful
for heroes who intend to be leaders as well as those who strike fear into the hearts of criminals with their presence.
Since this includes leadership it is also to a lesser degree charisma and attractiveness.</p>
<p>Your <b>Presence</b> modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will defense, for resisting attacks on your mind.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-INTIMIDATION">Intimidation</a>, and
<a href="skills.html#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill checks.</li>
<li><b>Presence</b> checks to influence others through force of personality when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you have no free will (the Gamemaster may control your character rather than you).
You retain all other mental traits but will do as you are told (even if you don't want to). Some complications are ignored
during this time (neither receive or spend victory points for the ignored ones). All interaction skills used on you always
pass. You will follow any command given to the best of your ability. The only decisions you are allowed to make are those
involved with completing a command. Even though you know the difference between friend and foe you can't chose one command
over another: the most recent instruction always trumps. You automatically fail any roll involving <b>Presence</b>.</p>
<p><a href="#TOC-ABSENT-ABILITIES">Absent</a> <b>Presence</b> is not allowed (even for NPCs) because being unable to
decide to do anything (even choosing to follow commands) means being unable to take actions.</p>
