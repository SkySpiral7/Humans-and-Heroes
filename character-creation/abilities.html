<h1 class="page-header-red">ABILITIES</h1>
<p>Everyone has certain basic <b>abilities</b>: how strong, fast, smart, and clever they are.
These abilities influence most things your character does. Stronger characters can lift greater weights, more agile
characters have better balance, tougher characters can soak up more damage, and so forth.</p>
<p>All characters have eight basic abilities: <b>Strength</b> (<b>Str</b>), <b>Stamina</b>
(<b>Sta</b>), <b>Dexterity</b> (<b>Dex</b>), <b>Agility</b> (<b>Agl</b>), <b>Fighting</b> (<b>Ftg</b>), <b>Intellect</b>
(<b>Int</b>), <b>Awareness</b> (<b>Awe</b>), and <b>Presence</b> (<b>Pre</b>). Strength, Dexterity, Agility and Stamina
are <b>physical abilities</b>, whereas Fighting, Intellect, Awareness, and Presence are <b>mental abilities</b>. Each
above-average ability provides a bonus on certain dice rolls; while below average abilities apply a penalty.</p>
<h1>ABILITY RANKS</h1>
<p>Each ability has a <b>rank</b> associated with it, based on how above or below average it is.
Abilities start at rank 0, the baseline average for an adult human being. Abilities can't go below -5 but, aside from
<a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>, there is no upper limit.</p>
<p>The ability rank is added to, or subtracted from, the sum of a dice roll when your character
does something related to that ability. For example, your Strength rank affects the amount of damage you do when
punching someone. Your Intellect rank comes into play when you roll skills based on Intellect, and so forth. Sometimes
your rank is used to calculate another value, such as when you use your Agility to determine how good you are at
avoiding harm with your reflexes (your Dodge defense).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-BUYING-ABILITY-RANKS">BUYING ABILITY RANKS</h2>
<p>You choose your hero's ability ranks by spending character points on them. Increasing an
ability rank by 1 costs 2 character points, so putting 4 points into Dexterity, for example, raises it from 0 to 2.
Remember a rank of 0 is average (See <b>Table: Ability Benchmarks</b>.)</p>
<p>It may be desirable to acquire ability ranks (some or all of them) via <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>
for thematic or mechanical reasons (see <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a> for explanation of both).
Note that ability ranks above 3 do not require <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>, this
contradiction is a snafu due to the DCs of <a href="skills.html">skills</a> (this difficult fix is being worked on).</p>

<p>Note that a rank of 3 is defined as "the peak of human achievement" in the description on <b>Table:
Ability Benchmarks</b>. A character with an ability rank greater than 3 isn't necessarily "non-human," merely superhuman
in comparison to ordinary people. Such a character isn't outside of the realm of physics just a human with unnatural talent
and skill beyond training. For a character that is strictly within human limitations read the warning in

<h2 id="TOC-REDUCING-ABILITIES">REDUCING ABILITIES</h2>
<p>You can also lower one or more of your character's ability ranks from the starting value of 0.
Each rank you lower an ability gives you an additional 2 character points to spend elsewhere. You cannot lower an
ability rank below -5, which is itself a serious deficiency.</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Ability Cost = 2 character points per +1 to an ability rank.</span>
<span class="generated-class-2">Gain 2 bonus character points per -1 to an ability rank.</span>
<p>Note that negative ability ranks is the only place in the game that gives back character points.
Also see <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html">Flaws</a> which reduce costs but never give back character points.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DEBILITATED-ABILITIES">DEBILITATED ABILITIES</h2>
<p>If one of your hero's ability ranks becomes -5 for any reason (eg <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a>),
that ability is said to be <b>debilitated</b> and you suffer more serious effects than just a penalty. You automatically
fail any rolls related to that ability including attacks and defense checks (except Debilitated Stamina). Ability ranks
cannot be lowered any further once they are debilitated (ie -5 is the minimum). When making a character abilities can be
lowered to -5 to gain 10 character points but doing so it not a good idea (see each ability below).</p>
<h2>ABSENT ABILITIES</h2>
<p>Player characters are not allowed to have absent abilities (see <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity
to fatigue</a> instead). Absent abilities exist to handle very unusual NPCs. Even then it is not possible to have absent
stamina.</p>
<p>Rather than having a rank of -5 in a given ability, some characters actually lack an ability altogether. This gives
back 10 character points (same as debilitated) and has the same effect as debilitated except more extreme where possible.
The ability is considered to be rank -&infin; and therefore can't be raised by <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>
(or lowered by <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a>).</p>
<p>For this reason it is not possible to have absent stamina as that would require being dead. Even zombies and robots
(both of which are considered alive by game mechanics) have stamina and in fact likely have infinite stamina for which
see <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity to fatigue</a>.</p>
<p>Absent abilities should be rare as it creates an unusual character with a serious disability. If you (as a Gamemaster
since players are not allowed to have absent abilities) are making a character with multiple absent abilities consider
if this should be a character at all. It may be better handled as an object, obstacle, circumstance, etc even if it has
<a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a> and the ability to die. Note that everything has Toughness (even inanimate
objects) and with enough <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a> can be destroyed. Plants and machines
can have other traits (such as Fortitude) and need not be characters.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SUPER-STRENGTH-AND-SPEED">SUPER STRENGTH AND SPEED</h2>
<p>Super strength and super speed are common super powers. The obvious way to do this is put many
ranks into Strength and Agility but this isn't a direct equivalent. For super
strength buy things like <a href="../examples/powers/power-lifting.html">Power Lifting</a>,
<a href="powers/effects/leaping.html">Leaping</a>, and <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>
(Strength-based). For super speed buy things like <a href="advantages.html#TOC-IMPROVED-INITIATIVE">Improved Initiative</a>
(likely as an <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>), <a href="powers/effects/quickness.html">Quickness</a>,
and <a href="powers/effects/movement.html#TOC-GROUND-SPEED">Ground Speed</a>.
For your convenience there are example power packages for <a
href="../examples/powers/super-strength.html">Super-Strength</a> and <a
href="../examples/powers/super-speed.html">Super-Speed</a> see them for details.</p>
<h1>THE ABILITIES</h1>
<p>Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">STRENGTH (STR)</h2>
<p>Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to apply it. It gives you the ability to
move anything that is physical.</p>
<p>Your Strength rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength-Based <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a> such as unarmed attacks.</li>
<li>How far you can jump (based on an <a href="skills.html#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a> skill check).</li>
<li>The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-ATHLETICS">Athletics</a> skill checks.</li>
<li>Strength checks for other feats of strength when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you must drop everything that you are carrying or holding (not clothing). Fall prone if
you are unable to do so. You automatically fail any roll involving Strength and can't use Strength based <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>
at all.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STAMINA-STA-">STAMINA (STA)</h2>
<p>Stamina is health, endurance, and overall physical resilience. Stamina is important because it
affects a character's ability to resist most forms of damage.</p>
<p>Your Stamina modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toughness defense, for resisting <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>.</li>
<li>Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your character's health.</li>
<li>Determining length of time before a Fortitude check needs to be made in cases like <a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-FORCED-LABOR">forced labor</a>
and <a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">suffocation</a>.</li>
<li>Note that there are no <a href="skills.html">skills</a> that use Stamina by default but some skills may use it in
some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: when stamina drops to -5 you become dying (your HP becomes -1 if not already negative)
and can't stabilize until your stamina is at least -4. Unlike other debilitated abilities you do not automatically fail
defense checks that use stamina (Fortitude and Toughness) instead you can make the check as though you had -5 Stamina
(you aren't able to make any ability or skill checks due to being incapacitated).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">AGILITY (AGL)</h2>
<p>Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coordination. It gives you the ability to move.</p>
<p>Your Agility rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dodge defense, for avoiding <a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">ranged attacks</a> and other hazards.</li>
<li>Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-ACROBATICS">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="skills.html#TOC-STEALTH">Stealth</a> skill checks.</li>
<li>Agility checks for feats of coordination, gross movement, and quickness when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you are immobilized. You automatically fail any roll involving Agility.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">DEXTERITY (DEX)</h2>
<p>Dexterity is a measure of hand-eye coordination, precision, and manual dexterity. It gives you the ability to manipulate
objects.</p>
<p>Your Dexterity rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged attack checks</a>.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-SLEIGHT-OF-HAND">Sleight of Hand</a> and <a href="skills.html#TOC-VEHICLES">Vehicles</a> skill checks.</li>
<li>Dexterity checks for feats of fine control and precision when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you drop everything you are holding, can't use fingers or other
fine motor skills. <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat: Unarmed</a> deals 1 less
<a href="powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a>. You automatically fail any roll involving Dexterity.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">FIGHTING (FGT)</h2>
<p>Fighting measures your character's ability in close combat, from hitting a target to ducking
and weaving around any counter-attacks. It gives you the ability to manipulate your own body.</p>
<p>Your Fighting rank applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Attack checks</a> for close attacks.</li>
<li>Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.</li>
<li>There are no other uses. General checks should use agility instead of fighting (see <a href="../meta/known-issues.html">known snafu</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: nothing special (always fail <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> and
Parry defense).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">INTELLECT (INT)</h2>
<p>Intellect covers reasoning ability, learning, memory and knowledge. A character with a high
Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and well-educated.</p>
<p>Your Intellect modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-COMMON-KNOWLEDGE">Common Knowledge</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-EXPERTISE">Expertise</a>,
<a href="skills.html#TOC-INVESTIGATION">Investigation</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-KNOWLEDGE">Knowledge</a>,
<a href="skills.html#TOC-MEMORY">Memory</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-STRATEGY">Strategy</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-TECHNOLOGY">Technology</a>,
and <a href="skills.html#TOC-TREATMENT">Treatment</a> skill checks.</li>
<li>Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-power when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you have no knowledge or memory beyond surface thoughts: the instant something is not
being thought about it is forgotten. You don't know who anyone is, what you are doing or why but some complications will
subconsciously remain influencing your actions. You are considered untrained in all skills (due to being unable to remember
training) and some advantages may be unavailable. Since you don't know what to do and why your actions are limited to
immediately obvious reactions to the situation. You automatically fail any roll involving Intellect.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">AWARENESS (AWE)</h2>
<p>Awareness covers wisdom, intuition, discernment, and perception. In contrast with Intellect which covers logic, facts,
quantitative observations, objectivity, and hard science; Awareness covers feelings, opinions, qualitative observations,
subjectivity, and soft science. Awareness covers the understanding part of social interactions, the rest being covered
by Presence. Simply put Awareness is your ability to sense what is going on.</p>
<p>A character with a high Intellect and a low Awareness may be an "absentminded professor" type,
smart but not always aware of what's going on. On the other hand, a not so bright (low Intellect) character may have
great deal of common sense (high Awareness).</p>
<p>A character with a low Presence and a high Awareness may understand the social nuances but be unable to sway people
in his favor. A character with a high Presence and a low Awareness may have natural charisma and a silver tongue but may
be too self-focused to notice others.</p>
<p>Your Awareness modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-INSIGHT">Insight</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-PERCEPTION">Perception</a>, and <a href="skills.html#TOC-TRACKING">Tracking</a>
skill checks.</li>
<li>Awareness checks to resolve matters of intuition when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you are unaware (all senses). None of your senses works and therefore you are immune to
interaction skills. You may still act although difficult since you are blind, deaf, and numb (everything has total
concealment from you). You automatically fail any roll involving Awareness.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">PRESENCE (PRE)</h2>
<p>Presence is force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability. Presence is useful
for heroes who intend to be leaders as well as those who strike fear into the hearts of criminals with their presence.
Since this includes leadership it is also to a lesser degree charisma and attractiveness.</p>
<p>Your Presence modifier applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will defense, for resisting attacks on your mind.</li>
<li><a href="skills.html#TOC-DECEPTION">Deception</a>, <a href="skills.html#TOC-INTIMIDATION">Intimidation</a>, and
<a href="skills.html#TOC-PERSUASION">Persuasion</a> skill checks.</li>
<li>Presence checks to influence others through force of personality when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If debilitated: you have no free will (the Gamemaster may control your character rather than you).
You retain all other mental traits but will do as you are told (even if you don't want to). Some complications are ignored
during this time (neither receive or spend victory points for the ignored ones). All interaction skills used on you always
pass. You will follow any command given to the best of your ability. The only decisions you are allowed to make are those
involved with completing a command. Even though you know the difference between friend and foe you can't chose one command
over another: the most recent instruction always trumps. You automatically fail any roll involving Presence.</p>
<h1>DEFENSES</h1>
<p>Heroes face many hazards in their line of work, from attacks by villainous foes to traps and
fiendish mind control. A hero's <b>defenses</b> are traits used to avoid such things, determining the difficulty to
affect a hero with an attack, or to make defense checks against them. Each defense is based on a particular ability,
modified by the hero's advantages and powers. For more on when defenses are used and what happens see <a
href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-DEFENSE">Action &amp; Adventure: Defense</a>.</p>
<p>Note that unlike ability scores, nothing special happens if a defense drops to 0 or below.
Toughness has no lower limit because there is no maximum limit to the number of bruised penalties.
However all other defense have an effective minimum based on the maximum possible <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a>
rank which is determined by power level. Although note that if the matching ability, except Stamina, is debilitated
then the defense will automatically fail.</p>
<p>Defenses are also used to measure the ability to overcome certain effects, involving a
<b>defense check</b> which consists of defense total plus a dice roll against a difficulty class or opposed roll as determined
by the effect or hazard.
So you might make a Parry defense check for your hero to avoid a sword thrust by a villain, for example, or a Dodge
defense check to evade a trap just as it is triggered, and so on. This may be referred to by abbreviation such as "Will check"
or by "resisting" such as "resisted by Fortitude".</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">DEFENSE RANK</h2>
<p>Your base defense ranks are equal to your ranks in their associated abilities. You can increase
your defenses (except toughness) above the values granted by your ability ranks by spending character points: 1 character point grants you
an additional rank in a defense, up to the <a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">limits imposed by power level</a>.</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Defense Cost = 1 character points per +1 rank</span>
<h3 id="TOC-TOUGHNESS-RANK">TOUGHNESS RANK</h3>
<p>The exception is Toughness, which can only be increased above your base Stamina rank using
advantages and powers, not by direct spending of character points. This reflects that greater-than-normal Toughness is
virtually always some sort of special ability. See <a href="advantages.html#TOC-DEFENSIVE-ROLL">Defensive Roll</a>,
<a href="powers/effects/protection.html">Protection</a>, and <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait: Toughness</a>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ACTIVE-DEFENSES">ACTIVE DEFENSES</h2>
<p>Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to be fully effective. Limits on your
mobility, focus, and reaction time adversely affect them. The conditions vulnerable and defenseless affect your active
defenses (see <a href="../gameplay/conditions.html">Conditions</a> for description).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DODGE">DODGE</h3>
<p>Dodge defense is based on Agility rank. It includes reaction time, quickness, nimbleness, and
overall coordination, used to avoid ranged attacks or other hazards where reflexes and speed are important.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-PARRY">PARRY</h3>
<p>Parry defense is based on Fighting. It is the ability to counter, duck, or otherwise evade a
foe's attempts to strike you in close combat through superior fighting ability. Note that Parry never provides a counter
attack for balance reasons.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PASSIVE-DEFENSES">PASSIVE DEFENSES</h2>
<p>Passive defenses are always present (unlike active defenses) even while unaware or incapacitated.
Passive defense are unaffected by the conditions vulnerable and defenseless and thus are always available.
The applicable active defense (if any) is rolled then the applicable passive defense is rolled and thus most attacks
must overcome two defenses.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FORTITUDE">FORTITUDE</h3>
<p>Fortitude defense is based on Stamina and measures health and resistance to threats like poison
or disease. It incorporates constitution, ruggedness, metabolism, and immunity.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TOUGHNESS">TOUGHNESS</h3>
<p>Toughness defense is based on Stamina and is resistance to direct damage or harm, and overall
durability.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-WILL">WILL</h3>
<p>Will defense is based on Presence rank. It measures mental stability, level-headedness,
determination, self-confidence, self-awareness, and willpower, used to resist mental or spiritual attacks.</p>
