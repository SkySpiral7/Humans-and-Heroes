<h2 id="TOC-STARTING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Starting Character Points</h2>
<p>The game's <a href="power-level.html">power level</a> provides a guideline for how many <b>Character points</b> you get initially to
design your character, as shown on the <b>Starting Character points</b> table (<b>Character points</b> =
<a href="power-level.html">power level</a> x 15).
The Gamemaster can vary the starting <b>Character points</b> as desired to suit the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a>.</p>
<p>The minimum <a href="power-level.html">power level</a> (for everyone) is 1 and there is no maximum. The minimum starting <b>Character points</b> for
player characters is 15. NPCs have a minimum of 0 <b>Character points</b>. There is no maximum number of <b>Character points</b>.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-SPENDING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Spending Character Points</h2>
<p>Each trait costs a certain number of <b>Character points</b>. You "spend" or allocate your points to
give your character different traits. Once spent, <b>Character points</b> cannot be reallocated without the use of a
<a href="powers/effects/variable.html">variable power</a> or the Gamemaster's permission (see
<a href="#TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">reallocating</a> below).
The basic costs of traits are given on the <b>Basic Trait Costs</b> table, with
specific costs for <a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a> given in
<a href="powers/effects/index.html">Powers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-GAINING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Gaining Character Points</h2>
<p>The Gamemaster awards heroes <b>Character points</b> over the course of a <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a>.
This represents the
experience and confidence the heroes have gained, along with other factors contributing to an increase in their
<a href="abilities.html">abilities</a>, <a href="skills.html">skills</a>, and <a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a>.
The Gamemaster decides when and how often to award <b>Character points</b>
at his discretion (see <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-AWARDING-CHARACTER-POINTS">awarding character points</a>).</p>
<p>Players can spend their heroes' awarded <b>Character points</b> in-between adventures to improve the heroes'
traits, limited only by the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> <a href="power-level.html">power level</a>. You can also choose to save up unspent <b>Character points</b>, waiting until
the <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-INCREASING-POWER-LEVEL">power level increases</a>, in order to spend them
to improve a trait already at its maximum rank.
Players spend <b>Character points</b> on new or improved traits for their heroes just the same as spending them to create
a hero. So if your hero has a power costing 2 points per rank, and you want to improve it by 1 rank, spend 2 of your
earned <b>Character points</b> to do so.</p>
<p>Just like starting <b>Character points</b>, once earned <b>Character points</b> have been allocated to a
trait, they remain that way, unless some effect causes the <b>character's point</b> allocation to
change (see <a href="#TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Reallocating Character points</a>
for more information). <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a> can cause a temporary loss of points
but once the effect wears off the <b>Character points</b> return exactly as they were before.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Reallocating Character Points</h2>
<p>Normally a hero's traits are fixed. Once <b>Character points</b> are spent on them, they remain there.
In some cases, however, the Gamemaster may allow players to reallocate their <b>characters' points</b>, changing their traits
within <a href="power-level.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">the limits of the series power level</a>, perhaps even losing some traits
and gaining entirely new ones. This is
typically a result of encountering a transformational effect
(intense radiation, mutagenic chemicals, cosmic power sources, and so forth). It's up to the GM when these
character-altering events occur, but they should be fairly rare unless their effects are intended to be temporary
<a href="complications.html">complications</a> or the player requested it.</p>
<p>In order to have fun it's important to play a character you enjoy so you may ask for a <b>point
reallocation</b> to correct mistakes. However such reallocations should be within reasonable limits. If you want to change
everything about your character it would be better explained that this is a different person. Additionally you should not
be able to change powers every single adventure, for that see <a href="powers/effects/variable.html">Variable</a>.</p>
<p>Note that when an <a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> is changed <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> and
<a href="defenses.html#TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">Defenses</a> are affected. Also see
<a href="powers/descriptors.html#TOC-CHANGING-DESCRIPTORS-IN-PLAY">Changing Descriptors</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CHARACTER-POINTS-OF-NON-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Character Points of Non-player Characters</h2>
<p>While the GM should keep the <a href="power-level.html">power level</a> guidelines and suggested starting <b>Character points</b> of
the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> in mind while creating villains and members of the supporting cast, non-player non-combatant characters
do not need to be so carefully tracked simply build with as many <b>Character points</b> as the GM wants to give them.
In other words, there
is no need to add up the "cost" of a non-player character. Just assign the appropriate traits at the desired
ranks. The <b>Character point</b> total may also be less than the recommended
starting <b>Character points</b> for that <a href="power-level.html">power level</a>, especially for
<a href="../examples/characters/animals/index.html">animals</a> which frequently have unspent points.</p>
<p>This is done to simplify some work of the Gamemaster: if it doesn't need an exact number then don't bother counting it.
Some NPCs don't need a character sheet beyond concept and name.</p>
