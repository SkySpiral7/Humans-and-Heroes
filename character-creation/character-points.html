<h1>Character Points</h1>
<p>You design a hero by spending <b>Character Points</b> on various traits. Each ability, skill,
advantage, power, and other trait has an associated Character point cost.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-STARTING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Starting Character Points</h2>
<p>The game's power level provides a guideline for how many Character points you get initially to
design your character, as shown on the <b>Starting Character points</b> table (Character points = power level x 15).
The Gamemaster can vary the starting Character points as desired to suit the series.</p>
<p>The minimum power level (for everyone) is 1 and there is no maximum. The minimum starting character points for
player characters is 15. NPCs have a minimum of 0 character points. There is no maximum number of character points.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-SPENDING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Spending Character Points</h2>
<p>Each trait costs a certain number of Character points. You "spend" or allocate your points to
give your character different traits. Once spent, Character points cannot be reallocated without the use of a particular
power or the Gamemaster's permission. The basic costs of traits are given on the <b>Basic Trait Costs</b> table, with
specific costs for powers given in <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-GAINING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Gaining Character Points</h2>
<p>The Gamemaster awards heroes Character points over the course of a series. This represents the
experience and confidence the heroes have gained, along with other factors contributing to an increase in their
abilities, skills, and powers. The Gamemaster decides when and how often to award character points
at his discretion (see <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-AWARDING-CHARACTER-POINTS">awarding character points</a>).</p>
<p>Players can spend their heroes' awarded Character points in-between adventures to improve the heroes'
traits, limited only by the series power level. You can also choose to save up unspent Character points, waiting until
the <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-INCREASING-POWER-LEVEL">power level increases</a>, in order to spend them
to improve a trait already at its maximum rank.
Players spend Character points on new or improved traits for their heroes just the same as spending them to create
a hero. So if your hero has a power costing 2 points per rank, and you want to improve it by 1 rank, spend 2 of your
earned Character points to do so.</p>
<p>Just like starting Character points, once earned Character points have been allocated to a
trait, they remain that way, unless some effect causes the character's point allocation to
change. See <a href="#TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Reallocating Character points</a>
for more information. <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a> can cause a temporary loss of points
but once the effect wears off the character points return exactly as they were before.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">Reallocating Character Points</h2>
<p>Normally a hero's traits are fixed. Once Character points are spent on them, they remain there.
In some cases, however, the Gamemaster may allow players to reallocate their characters' points, changing their traits
within <a href="power-level.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">the limits of the series power level</a>, perhaps even losing some traits
and gaining entirely new ones. This is
typically a result of encountering a transformational effect
(intense radiation, mutagenic chemicals, cosmic power sources, and so forth). It's up to the GM when these
character-altering events occur, but they should be fairly rare unless their effects are intended to be temporary
complications or the player requested it.</p>
<p>In order to have fun it's important to play a character you enjoy so you may ask for a point
reallocation to correct mistakes. However such reallocations should be within reasonable limits. If you want to change
everything about your character it would be better explained that this is a different person. Additionally you should not
be able to change powers every single adventure, for that see <a href="powers/effects/variable.html">Variable</a>.</p>
<p>Note that when an <a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> is changed <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> and
<a href="defenses.html#TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">Defenses</a> are affected.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CHARACTER-POINTS-OF-NON-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Character Points of Non-player Characters</h2>
<p>While the GM should keep the power level guidelines and suggested starting Character points of
the series in mind while creating villains and members of the supporting cast, non-player non-combatant characters
do not need to be so carefully tracked simply build with as many Character points as the GM wants to give them.
In other words, there
is no need to add up the "cost" of a non-player character. Just assign the appropriate traits at the desired
ranks. The Character point total may also be less than the recommended
starting Character points for that power level, especially for animals which frequently have unspent points.</p>
<p>This is done to simplify some work of the Gamemaster: if it doesn't need an exact number then don't bother counting it.
Some NPCs don't need a character sheet beyond concept and name.</p>
