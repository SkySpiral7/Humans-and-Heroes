<div>Under the Hood: Variable Effects</div>
<div>
<p>Powers based off the <b>Variable</b> effect are obviously very flexible, capable of duplicating
a wide range of other effects. Responsibility for controlling <b>Variable</b> effects in the game is placed largely in
the hands of both the Gamemaster and responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with
numerous game-system limitations that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of
effects.</p>
<p>Keep in mind a <b>Variable</b> effect is not supposed to be "any effect I want." That kind of
unlimited power doesn't belong in the hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A
<b>Variable</b> effect can be any effect within a given set of parameters, but it's up to you and the GM to define those
parameters. The limits of power flexibility are deliberately set by <b>Variable</b> effects, the use of extra effort,
and victory points.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many magic-wielding character in stories tend to have the ability to do anything
they can think of, however this game won't give players a blank check to duplicate any effect in the
game an unlimited number of times since that causes major game balance issues (and will likely slow the game down).
Magic works well as a descriptor which
can be applied to any power but there's no magic example power and you can't have a <b>Variable</b> effect of "anything
magic" because that has no real limitation.
However, generally speaking, magic users have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with character
points) and "stunts" they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly
victory points).</p>
<p><b>Variable</b> effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and
define everything about a given power in advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an
application of the <a href="morph.html">Morph</a> effect with a long list of <a
href="enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a> options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at
a time, would be tedious to say the least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A
<b>Variable</b> effect, with the descriptor "animal forms" is easier to manage. The player can prebuild certain commonly
used animal forms for use during play, but also has the option to new configurations that fit into the power's
descriptors. See the <a href="../../../examples/powers/index.html#TOC-EXAMPLE-TABLE">Sample Powers</a> section for some examples of
<b>Variable</b> effects in practice.</p>
<p>In short, <b>Variable</b> effect is a "last resort" in power design, and the GM should treat it
as such.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can gain or use potentially any effect of the appropriate type and descriptor! A
<b>Variable</b> effect provides you with a set of (rank x 5) character points you can allocate to different effects.
This power has a minimum cost of 5/rank, flaws can't reduce it further.
Take an action on your turn and choose where to allocate your <b>Variable</b> character points. It is a good idea to
have a "menu" of commonly used options written down in advance to help speed up this process during play.</p>
<p>The effects you gain from your <b>Variable</b> effect are subject to the normal power level and
series limits. So you cannot, for example, acquire <a href="enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a> as a
<b>Variable</b> effect to improve a trait beyond its power level limit, or acquire effects or descriptors the Gamemaster
has specifically banned from the series. The GM has final say as to whether or not a particular use of a <b>Variable</b>
effect is appropriate and may veto your allocations, if necessary. You can't use <b>Variable</b> to decrease any of your
normal traits (even if you are <a href="../../../examples/powers/mimic.html">mimicing</a> someone with negative abilities). Additionally you
can't buy <a href="../../advantages.html">advantages</a> that wouldn't make sense such as <a href="../../advantages.html#TOC-BENEFIT">wealth</a>.</p>
<p>You must also place descriptors on your <b>Variable</b> effect limiting its scope. For example,
a <b>Variable</b> effect that mimics other's traits is limited to the traits its subject(s) possess; a <b>Variable</b>
effect providing you with traits suitable to different shapes is limited by the form(s) you assume; a <b>Variable</b>
effect providing adaptations is limited to the stimulus to which it adapts, and so forth. This descriptor does not
reduce the effect's cost unless it's especially narrow or limiting, and the GM is the final arbiter of what constitutes
a suitable descriptor and which descriptors are narrow enough to qualify for a Limited flaw.</p>
<p>The allocation of your <b>Variable</b> points is sustained by default, so if you stop
maintaining your <b>Variable</b> effect for any reason, your allocated points "reset" to a "null" state: you lose any
temporary traits and must take the action necessary to reallocate your <b>Variable</b> points again on your turn to
regain them. Points in a Continuous <b>Variable</b> effect remain where you set them without maintenance, unless the
<b>Variable</b> effect itself is countered or nullified. <b>Variable</b> cannot be permanent in duration by definition.
However the effects gained by <b>Variable</b> may have permanent duration which would mean the the power gained can't be
countered although <b>Variable</b> can still be countered or ended to end the effect gained. In this way a Continuous
<b>Variable</b> can gain the effect of Permanent <a href="immortality.html">Immortality</a> and in the event of
death, powers gained by <b>Variable</b> will end as described in <a
href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-DEATH">Gameplay Rules: Death</a> with <b>Immortality</b> continuing
by definition and <b>Variable</b> continuing because it is providing <b>Immortality</b>.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Faster Action</b>: You can change the configuration of your effect faster.
Gamemasters should exercise caution with <b>Variable</b> effects that can be reconfigured as a free action:
they not only grant tremendous flexibility, they can also slow down game play as the player considers virtually infinite
possibilities for each action using the <b>Variable</b> effect. <b>Move Action: +1 cost per rank . Free Action: +2 cost
per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Affects Others</b>: You can grant effects to someone else. The subject granted the use of
the effect controls its configuration, if appropriate for its descriptors (although you retain the ability to withdraw
use of the effect altogether whenever you wish). <b>Affects Others Only: +0 cost per rank. Affects Others or yourself:
+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Perception</b>: Applied to a Ranged Affects Others <b>Variable</b>, this extra allows you to
grant the benefits of the effect to any target you can accurately perceive. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Ranged</b>: A <b>Variable</b> effect with Affects Others may have the Ranged extra to
improve the range at which you can grant the effect to another. This does not alter the ranges of the effect's various
configurations. To do so, apply the Range modifier to the effect(s) within a particular configuration. <b>+1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Limited</b>: As noted in the description, a <b>Variable</b> effect must be limited by
certain descriptors by default. To qualify for this flaw, the effect must be even more limited. This is highly
situational and left to the Gamemaster's judgment. An example is a <b>Variable</b> effect only able to provide Enhanced
Skills; in most settings, this is Limited. However, in settings where powers are rare and most characters rely on
skills, it might not be. Conversely, a <b>Variable</b> effect prohibited from providing Enhanced Skills, but able to
provide a wide range of other effects, isn't particularly Limited, just defined by its descriptors. <b>-1 cost
per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Slow</b>: You can only reconfigure your <b>Variable</b> effect outside of action time. You
might need access to a lab, arsenal, spell-book, or other special equipment, or need to perform certain procedures or
rituals. It takes at least a minute, possibly as long as an hour or more. The GM sets the specific time in cases where
it matters, but it should be short enough that you can reconfigure between scenes in a game, but long enough that you
effectively cannot do it during action time. The GM may allow you to spend a victory point to reconfigure your
<b>Variable</b> effect during action time as a power stunt, if circumstances warrant it. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
