<h1>Leaping</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Movement &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Move &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</span>
<p>You can make prodigious leaps, far more than even a skilled athlete. Your <b>Leaping</b> rank, minus
your total <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight rank</a> (minimum 0), is the
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">distance rank</a> you cover in a single standing jump.</p>
<p>You do not suffer any fall damage (whether you were jumping or not) which is within your maximum <b>Leaping</b>
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">distance</a>.
An average human has a <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight rank</a> of 2.
If your <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight rank</a> is negative then it is considered 0 instead.
Note that your total <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight rank</a> includes what you are carrying
so you can use ranks of <b>Leaping</b> to carry things that your <a href="../../abilities.html#TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength</a>
wouldn't normally allow.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">speed rank</a> of your leap maxes out at 6, so leaps of greater
than <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">distance rank</a> 6 take time equal to the
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">distance rank</a> minus 6. For example, a massive leap of
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">distance rank</a> 16 takes
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">time rank</a> 10 (16 - 6, or two hours) of time in the air! Because of this, leapers may choose to make
shorter "hops", leaving them airborne for only a minute or so, to better control their direction.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Affects Others</b>: You can give someone you are touching the ability to leap like you do
while the effect lasts. You do not need this extra to simply carry someone while you leap; you can carry what your
Strength normally allows. This allows the character you are affecting to also carry what that character's strength
allows. <b>+0 or +1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Full Power</b>: With this flaw, you can only leap your maximum distance; you can make
shorter leaps only by not using your Leaping effect at all, just the normal jumping distance for your Strength. This may
suit uncontrollable "leaping" effects like rocket boosters and the like. <b>Flat -1 point.</b></p>
