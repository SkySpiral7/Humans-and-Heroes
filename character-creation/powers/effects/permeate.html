<h1>Permeate</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Movement &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Move &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</span>
<p>You can pass through solid objects as if they weren't there. You remain solid while using
<b>Permeate</b> but the object moves around you (becoming temporarily more dense in certain places) so if you are inside an
object when <b>Permeate</b> is deactivated you can't move but, unlike <a href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a>,
don't take damage from it. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or collapses behind you immediately (your
choice when you begin down each new tunnel). Material density is equal to Material toughness for simplicity (see table
below).</p>
<p>You move through any material with a speed = <b>Permeate</b> rank + your strength - material toughness - 5
with a maximum of normal movement speed. If you would be moving at a speed of -10 or less you stop moving entirely
unable to pass through the material at all. The maximum speed you can move is equal to your effective
movement speed if there wasn't any material in the way. For example, If you had <b>Permeate</b> 8, Strength 2, and <a
href="flight.html">Flight</a> 4 then <b>Permeate</b> would let you move through soil at speed rank 5 but caps out at
your maximum movement speed of 4. While inside an object <b>Permeate</b> effectively provides a <a href="flight.html">
Platform Flight</a> but only if you close the tunnels behind you.</p>
<p>You cannot breathe while completely inside a solid object, so you either need <a href="immunity.html#TOC-SUFFOCATION">
Immunity to Suffocation</a> or have to hold your breath. You'll also want <a href="senses.html#TOC-PENETRATES-CONCEALMENT">
Senses that Penetrates Concealment</a> to know where you're going, since you can't normally see inside solid objects.</p>
<p>Permeate provides no protection against attacks, although you do gain <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-COVER">cover</a>
while inside an object. For the ability to allow things (including attacks) to pass through you, see <a href="insubstantial.html">
Insubstantial</a>.</p>

<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Free Modifiers</h2>
<p><b>Not Strength Based</b>: <b>Permeate</b> uses the same form as above but replace all references to
strength with 0 and attack checks are never required (a power check might be required in certain circumstances) although
your speed is still the same. The reason why the default is Strength Based is because it is easier to explain this way.
The reason why this is a free modifier is the same reason as strength-based damage: if your strength is hindered so is
the effect. <b>+0</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Limited</b>: <b>Permeate</b> may be limited to certain circumstances or materials, such as only
loose earth, ice, or metal leaving you unable to move through another material even if weaker. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
