<h1>Resistance</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Defense &#8226; <b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 3 points per rank</span>
<p>You can better resist certain <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptors</a>. When taken choose a
<a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a> or a base power to
resist. The <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a> chosen can include natural causes such as suffocation.
You can't apply the <b>Variable
Descriptor</b> modifier to this power. If you have more than one <b>Resistance</b> of the same type then only the
highest applies. However if you have multiple <b>Resistance</b> of different types it is possible for each to apply to
the same effect.</p>
<p>When you are affected by that <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a> after you roll an activate defense but before
you roll a passive defense, subtract your <b>Resistance</b> rank from that power as though <b>Resistance</b>
was automatically <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countering</a> that effect. If the effect would be reduced
to 0 or less then you are immune to the effect but the effect isn't <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countered</a>
(and therefore an <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">area</a> effect will still affect others).
If you are have more than one <b>Resistance</b> that might make you immune they each subtract. For example if you have
Fire <b>Resistance</b> 5 and Magic <b>Resistance</b> 5 and are attacked by magical fire then subtract 10.
If the effect isn't reduced to 0 or less then roll your passive defense normally.</p>
<p>This power has a maximum rank equal to the power level. Note that this is more worth while than
<b>Enhanced Trait</b>: Toughness limited to fire (1 point per 2 ranks) because: you can have both this and high
toughness and this will resist effects that are not resisted by toughness.
This power is cheaper than a <a href="nullify.html">Nullify</a> <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AURA">Aura</a>
at the cost of only making you immune instead of ending the effect (there is little difference for single target attacks).</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Area</b>: If you make <b>Resistance</b> an area effect then everyone (or everything) in the
area will benefit. There is little difference between this and <a href="nullify.html">Nullify</a>
<a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AURA">Aura</a>.
<b>See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a> for cost and details.</b></p>
