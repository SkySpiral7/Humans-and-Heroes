Without it you'll have to use the <a href="../../../site-map.html">sitemap</a> in order easily navigate.</p>

<p>sideBar.js is harmless: it simply generates hyperlinks to major pages. It exists in a single place so that
I don't have to update 100+ html pages with relative links whenever I want to change it.</p>

<h1>Growth</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: General &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 6 points per rank</span>
<p>You can temporarily increase your size, gaining various bonuses such as Strength and Stamina
while becoming a bigger and heavier at the cost of various penalties such as less agile target, unable to maneuver
through small spaces. <b>Growth</b> modifiers are restricted by power level limits.</p>
<p>Each rank of <b>Growth</b> doubles your <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a> (increase <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a>
by 1 rank). Ordinary humans start out at <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size rank</a> -2 (between 3 and 6 feet tall).
You also get +1 base speed, +1 Strength, +1 Stamina, and +1 <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass</a> (which causes +1
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight</a> under Earth's gravity). These bonuses
are known as absolute size bonuses but you are also affected by <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-RELATIVE-SIZE-RULES">Relative
size penalties and bonuses</a>. If you lack Stamina
instead get +1 Fortitude and +1 Toughness.</p>
<p>Note that <b>Growth</b> and <a href="shrinking.html">Shrinking</a> in size must be bodily
proportional meaning if your head grows in size by 3 ranks so must the rest of your body. In order to assume forms of
other proportions see <a href="morph.html">Morph</a>.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Immovable</b>: The <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass</a> you gain is unaffected by gravity
(thus your <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight</a> doesn't increase). Anything based on
your <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass</a> still applies such as being harder to move or trip. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b><a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-LINKED">Linked</a> <a href="morph.html">Morph</a>
</b>: By <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-LINKED">linking</a> to <a href="morph.html">Morph</a> (1 rank)
<b>Growth</b> no longer needs to be bodily proportional as long as <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass</a>,
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size (height)</a>, and <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">volume</a> are correct. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Opposite Duration</b>: Instead of using the power to become abnormal sized you use it to
become normal sized. Your default <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a> is not rank -2 (6 ft). For
example Opposite Duration <b>Growth</b> 2 would mean your innate <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a>
is rank 0 and you activate this power to become <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a> -2 so that if
<a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countered</a> or during power loss you return to the
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size rank</a> 0.
This exists as a much cheaper alternative to having Permanent Innate <b>Growth</b> and
<a href="shrinking.html">Shrinking</a>. A power with this
modifier can't increase ranks since that would change your character's default <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a>.
<b>Growth</b> with this modifier can't
also have permanent duration since that defeats the purpose. <b>+1 cost per rank</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Remove Absolute Size Bonus</b>: You retain either your <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">Size</a>,
Strength, Stamina, or <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass</a>
while using this power. Choose only one of those traits per application but you can't have four applications to choose
them all since then the power would do nothing. Note that you can't choose base speed since that is determined by
absolute size. <b>-1 cost per rank per application.</b></p>
