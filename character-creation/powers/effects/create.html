<div>Under the Hood: Create vs. Summon</div>
<div>
<p>Create and <a href="summon-minion.html">Summon Minion</a> are similar effects: both "create" things
out of nowhere. So when should a character have one and not the other?</p>
<p>Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while <a href="summon-minion.html">Summon Minion</a>
conjures creatures of some sort, capable of independent action (albeit limited in the case of mindless creatures like
robots or zombies). So a character able to create "sculptures" of ice, for example: walls, slides, columns, and so
forth, should have Create. A character able to call up animated snowmen, on the other hand, should have Summon, while a
powerful "ice elemental" may very well have both effects!</p>

<div>Under the Hood: Anti Matter and Dark Matter</div>
<div>
<p>Dark Matter does nothing except increase mass which can be done instead with a <a href="../../../examples/powers/heavy.html">Heavy</a>
Attack. Anti-matter explodes as soon as it touches regular matter, such as air, so instead use a Area Burst <a
href="damage.html">Damage</a> effect with descriptors.</p>

<p>You can form solid objects essentially out of nowhere. This power essentially has two durations
the first being Instant which creates the object and the second being the duration shown above for maintaining the
object. They may be made of solidified energy, "hardened" water or air, transmuted bulk matter, ice, stone, or some
other medium, depending on the effect's descriptors. They must be made out of a single material chosen when this power
is obtained. Note that the material chosen is only cosmetic: it won't share any of the properties of that material except
by applying innate object. If you want to be able to create any material you will need to use <a
href="transform.html">Transform</a> with the Any material extra. They can be solid or
hollow, opaque or translucent, as you choose when you use the effect, limited by your descriptors and the Gamemaster's
judgment. The created objects have the single color of whatever they are made out of. You can never create life or
transform an object to gain life. They can't be transparent without the subtle modifier.</p>
<p>You can form any simple geometric shape or common object, such as: cube, sphere, dome, hammer,
lens, disk, sand, pillow. The Gamemaster has final say on whether or not a particular object is too complex for this effect. Generally,
your objects can't have any moving parts more complex than a hinge. If you want to be able to create more complex shapes
you will need to use <a href="transform.html">Transform</a> with the Ignore complexity extra.</p>
<p>You can create an object with a maximum <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">volume</a>, <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass</a>,
and Toughness ranks equal to your effect rank.
The toughness is still limited by <a href="../../index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>
in which case mass and volume may exceed the toughness.
Created objects can be damaged or broken like ordinary objects. They also vanish if you
stop maintaining them. You can repair any damage to a created object by using your effect again (essentially
"re-creating" the object). Your created objects are stationary once you have created them, although other effects can
move them (such as gravity). Create can't have Permanent duration, if you want an object to own buy it as equipment.</p>
<p>If you want to trap characters with objects instead use <a
href="affliction.html">Affliction</a>: Dazed, immobile, paralyzed.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CREATED-OBJECTS-COVER-AND-CONCEALMENT">Created Objects, Cover, And Concealment</h3>
<p>A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the object is opaque) just like a normal
object. Cover provided by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks outgoing attacks as well. Attacks
hitting the covering object damage it normally (see <b>Damaging Objects</b>). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a
created object provides just like any other cover (see <b>Indirect</b> modifier). If you would like to create armor see
<a href="protection.html">Protection</a> with descriptors instead.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DROPPING-OBJECTS">Dropping Objects</h3>
<p>Simply dropping a created object on a target is treated like a Cylinder Area Effect attack
based on the object's size (see <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a> extra) it is also shapeable due to the
nature of create. The object inflicts damage equal to its weight, and targets get a Dodge check to evade the falling
object, like normal area attacks.</p>
<p>While a created object can potentially be wielded as an improvised weapon, the effect cannot
otherwise create attacks or other effects; you must acquire these effects separately (perhaps as Alternate Effects). Or
have an <a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ACTIVATION">Activated</a> <a href="damage.html">Damage</a> with
descriptors.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SUPPORTING-WEIGHT">Supporting Weight</h3>
<p>If a created object needs to support weight--created as a bridge or to support a weakened
structure, for example--it has an effective Strength equal to its toughness rank. You can "shore up" a created object by
taking a standard action and concentrating, increasing its Strength by 1 for 1 round. You can
also use extra effort to increase a created object's Strength by 1 for 1 round, these modifiers are cumulative.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Innate Object</b>: Create with this modifier makes objects that cannot be nullified as
ongoing effects, they're essentially "real" objects for all intents and purposes (although the creator can "unmake" them by
ending the effect). The object must have the same properties that a real object would have but toughness is still limited
by both effect rank and <a href="../../index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>.
Therefore you can't select a material that would exceed the restrictions nor can you have the proportional flaw.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Innate Power</b>: This is the standard innate modifier which means that the power to create
objects can't be Nullified. This is relatively useless since the object can still be Nullified as an ongoing effect thus
ending the duration. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Selective</b>: You can selectively tangible, making your objects solid to some creatures and
incorporeal to others. But attacks can never go through even if the person is inside the object. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Subtle</b>: This modifier either makes created objects not noticeable as constructs for 1
rank (they look just like real objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects composed of invisible
force). <b>Flat +1or 2 points.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Free Modifiers</h2>
<p><b>Tether</b>: You have a connection to your created objects, allowing you to exert your own
Strength to move them (provided you are strong enough to do so). It is always possible to use your strength to move your
objects, this extra just makes it possible from a distance. Note that this is tethered to you and can't be disarmed
but can be broken which ends the duration. <b>+0 points.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Feedback</b>: You may suffer damage when your created objects are damaged (see
<b>Feedback</b> flaw for details). <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Proportional</b>: Your created objects have a total volume rank plus Toughness rank equal to
your Create rank, rather than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you can create an object with volume rank 0
and Toughness equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in between, so long as the sum of the two ranks does
not exceed your Create rank and Toughness is a minimum of 0.
In this case the object's <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass rank</a> is equal to the object's Toughness. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
