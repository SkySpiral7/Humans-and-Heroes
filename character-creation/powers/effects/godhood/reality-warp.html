Without it you'll have to use the <a href="../../../../site-map.html">sitemap</a> in order easily navigate.</p>

<p>sideBar.js is harmless: it simply generates hyperlinks to major pages. It exists in a single place so that
I don't have to update 100+ html pages with relative links whenever I want to change it.</p>

<h1>Reality Warp</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Control &#8226; <b>Based on</b>: <b>Selective</b> <a
href="../transform.html">Transform</a> &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Perception
&#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Continuous &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 80 points</span>
<p>Instead of transforming matter you can alter physics. The selective modifier is built in for
free. You may increase or decrease values, you can affect only certain areas, you can add or remove laws of physics
entirely. Such as reversing the gravity of all black holes, causing time to slow down in a 30 ft cube, revoking the
inverse square law, or reversing strong and weak nuclear forces so that every atom in the universe explodes (including
your own). This power can easily cause widespread destruction and chaos but is not intended for that purpose. If you are
affecting an area, that isn't an entire universe, then you must be within perception range of the center of the area
affected. If you are affecting an entire universe then you must be within perception of any point of that universe. This
power has 16 <b>Phantom Ranks</b> and you can't increase its ranks directly, you must use more <b>Phantom
Ranks</b>.</p>
<p>Characters with this power can choose to be unaffected by physics thus making some forms of
<b>Immunity</b> obsolete.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Dimensional</b>: You can affect other dimensions. See modifiers for more details on the
scope. You can now create bridges and interactions between the dimensions. <b>see modifiers for cost</b></p>
