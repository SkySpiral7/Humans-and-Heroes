<p>There is a trait that PCs have but players do not need to be aware of called Transcendence. Transcendence
can't be enhanced or obtained in any way, such as from <b>Variable</b> or <b>Enhanced Trait</b>, but can only be granted
by the GM or due to power level. The short explanation of what Transcendence does is to say that minions have
Transcendence -1 and players have Transcendence 0 but there is also a Transcendence 1 and above. There is no
Transcendence below -1. Characters with Transcendence 1 (aka Transcendent 1) are so much more powerful than
Transcendence 0 and may interact with them using the minion rules. Characters with Transcendence 1+ are not necessarily
gods although citizens tend to have a hard time telling the difference between god-like characters and actual gods and
demigods due to the immense power.</p>
<p>At power level 20 a character will have Transcendence 1 and every 20 power levels after that
gain another Transcendence. It is possible for a character to have more Transcendence than power level would suggest but
not less: power level 20 characters must have at least Transcendence 1. Minions have Transcendence determined by power
level as normal but have a maximum Transcendence equal to 1 less than their master. All player characters have a minimum
Transcendence of 0. All objects have Transcendence -1. Non-player characters with power levels 0-2 have Transcendence -1
and power levels 3-19 have Transcendence 0. Citizens and other irrelevant characters are usually minions (T -1). If you
don't like the idea of a sudden ascendance of power from PL 19 to PL 20, you may decide to ease in the transition by
allowing some features but not others at a lower PL.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MINION-RULES-REVISED">Minion Rules Revised</h3>
<p>As long as your HP is 1 or less you are treated as though you had 1 less Transcendence than
normal (with exceptions).</p>
<p>You cannot score critical hits against an opponent of higher Transcendence. This only applies
to natural Transcendence and not one imposed by low HP.</p>
<p>If you attack an opponent of lower Transcendence you may do so as a routine check (only against
active defenses not passive).</p>
<p>If you are 2 or more Transcendence lower and you use <b>Nullify</b> or <b>Weaken</b> against
your opponent, you automatically fail.</p>
<p>If you are 1 Transcendence lower and you use <b>Nullify</b> or <b>Weaken</b> against your
opponent, you are considered to have rolled a -3 instead of rolling but this is not considered a critical failure.</p>
<p>If Transcendence is the same then <b>Nullify</b> and <b>Weaken</b> are rolled normally.</p>
<p>If you are 1 Transcendence higher and use <b>Nullify</b> (but not <b>Weaken</b>) against your
opponent, you are considered to have rolled a +3 instead of rolling but this is not considered a critical success.</p>
<p>If you are 2 or more Transcendence higher and use <b>Nullify</b> (but not <b>Weaken</b>)
against your opponent, you automatically succeed.</p>
<p>If a character with Transcendence -1 fails a defense check, that character suffers the worst
degree of the effect. This only applies to natural Transcendence and not one imposed by having 1 HP or less.</p>
<p>HP minimum is always -3. A character with Transcendence -1 has a maximum HP of 1
everyone else has a maximum HP of 6.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-BENEFITS-OF-TRANSCENDENCE">Benefits Of Transcendence</h3>
<p>The following rules apply to characters with Transcendence 1 or more:</p>
<p>Characters with Transcendence 1+ are also allowed to use Fortitude to resist <b>Nullify</b>
since their powers have become a part of them.</p>
<p>There are some powers and upgrades that are listed below that can only be purchased by a
character with at least Transcendence 1 (see New Traits below).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-NEW-TRAITS">New Traits</h3>
<p>Each of the following powers and advantages can only be purchased by a character with at least
Transcendence 1 although you may make exceptions. God-like characters tend to also have <b>Concealment</b> from
<b>Detect Transcendence</b> and <b>Concealment</b> from <b>Analytical Detect Powers</b> assuming they don't already have
the <b>Beyond Mortal</b> Godhood advantage. If (Senses) <b>Detect Transcendence</b> is used on a character with
Transcendence -1 or 0 it will indicate absence and if used against a character of Transcendence 1+ it will indicate
presence. Each of the Transcendent advantages can't be mimiced in any way even by a higher Transcendence character (not even
via <a href="a-god-i-am.html">A God I Am</a>). In
order for a device to have a Transcendence power the maker must be at least Transcendence 2.</p>
