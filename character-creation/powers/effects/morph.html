<p>Please enable JavaScript in order to see the generated sidebar.
Without it you'll have to use the <a href="../../../site-map.html">sitemap</a> in order easily navigate.</p>

<p>sideBar.js is harmless: it simply generates hyperlinks to major pages. It exists in a single place so that
I don't have to update 100+ html pages with relative links whenever I want to change it.</p>

<h1>Morph</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: General &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</span>
<p>You can alter your appearance. Your traits do not change; your new form is merely a cosmetic
change and only visual. You can look exactly like your target limited by perception and knowledge of your target. Note
that this is only a visual change meaning you do not have the same voice as your target (see Linked below). When using
<b>Morph</b> as a disguise you receive a bonus to <a href="../../skills.html#TOC-DISGUISE">Deception: Disguise</a> equal
to your power rank (within the maximum specified by <a href="../../index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>).</p>
<p>You can assume any form of the same <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">mass rank</a> and
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size rank</a> as your own. Note that the default
<a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a> for
a human is <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">distance rank</a> -2 (between 3 and 6 feet tall).
Affects Objects can't be applied, instead see <a href="transform.html">Transform</a>. Morph can't be permanent.</p>
<p>For the ability to change <a href="../../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">size</a> as well as
appearance see the <a href="growth.html">Growth</a><b> </b>and <a href="shrinking.html">Shrinking</a>
effects. To take on the other traits of forms you assume, see the <a href="variable.html">Variable</a><b>
</b>effect.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Attack</b>: A Morph Attack imposes a different appearance on the target creature. This is
entirely cosmetic: you can't change the target's traits other than appearance although it is not uncommon for <a
href="weaken.html">Weaken</a> to Link to Morph. <b>+1 points.</b></p>
<p><b>Linked Illusion</b>: Use minor illusions to trick senses beyond visual such as: mimic voice,
natural scent, etc. These illusions can't be resisted until your disguise is seen through or if the subject has
appropriate <a href="senses.html#TOC-COUNTERS-ILLUSION">senses that counter illusions</a>. If you want your visual
appearance to be illusionary as well, use
<a href="../modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-RESISTIBLE">Resistible</a>. <b>See <a href="illusion.html">Illusion</a> for cost</b></p>
<p><b>Precise</b>: Precise is built in and can't be applied again. <b>0 points.</b></p>
