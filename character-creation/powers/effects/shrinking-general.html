<h1>SHRINKING (GENERAL)</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 3 points per rank</span>
<p>You can temporarily decrease your size, becoming smaller, harder to see -- and hit -- and other
various bonuses at the cost of various penalties such as losing Strength and speed. <b>Shrinking</b> modifiers are restricted
by power level limits.</p>
<p>Each rank of <b>Shrinking</b> reduces your size rank by 1. Ordinary humans start out at size rank -2,
between 3 and 6 feet tall. You also suffer -1 base speed, -1 Strength, -1 Stamina, and -1 mass. These penalties are
known as absolute size penalties but you are also affected by Relative size penalties and bonuses. If you lack Stamina
instead get -1 Fortitude and -1 Toughness.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Atomic</b>: At <b>Shrinking</b> 20 (and size rank -22), you can shrink down to the molecular or even
atomic level, allowing you to pass through solid objects by slipping between their atoms. It takes at least a full turn
to do so, possibly longer for larger objects. You're effectively immune to damage and many effects at this scale, since
you are essentially shifted out of the ordinary universe. The GM decides if a particular effect can reach you at the
atomic level. If you have this extra, you might also acquire a Dimensional Travel effect allowing you to shift into a
sub-atomic "universe" or similar realm. Note this would normally require <b>Shrinking</b> rank 33 (size -35). <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>

<b>Shrinking</b> no longer needs to be bodily proportional as long as mass, size
(height), and volume are correct. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Opposite Duration</b>: Instead of using the power to become abnormal sized you use it to
become normal sized. Your default size is not rank -2 (6 ft). For example Opposite Duration <b>Shrinking</b> 2 would mean your
innate size is -4 and you activate this power to become size -2 so that if countered or during power loss you return to the
size -4. This exists as a much cheaper alternative to having Permanent Innate <b>Shrinking</b> and
<a href="growth-general.html">Growth</a>. A power with this modifier
can't increase ranks since that would change your character's default size. <b>Shrinking</b> with this modifier can't also have
permanent duration since that defeats the purpose. <b>+1 cost per rank</b></p>
<p><b>Remove Absolute Size Penalty</b>: You retain either your Strength, Stamina, or Mass while
shrunk. Choose only one of those traits per application. Note that you can't choose base speed since that is determined
by absolute size. <b>+1 cost per rank per application.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Retain Size</b>: When shrinking your Strength, Stamina, and Mass may change but your size
does not. You can't choose this modifier if you have also removed all three traits since then the power would do
nothing. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
