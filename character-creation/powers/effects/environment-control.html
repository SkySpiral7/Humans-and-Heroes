<h1>ENVIRONMENT (CONTROL)</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1-2 points per rank</span>
<p>You can change the environment in an area: raising or lowering the temperature, creating light,
causing rain, and so forth (see <b>The Environment</b> in <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html">Action &amp;
Adventure</a> for details). This power by default works equally well indoors and outside (see <a
href="#TOC-FLAWS">Limited to Outdoor use only</a> below).</p>
<p>Your Environment affects a 30 foot radius around you at rank 1. Each additional rank moves the
radius up one distance rank, for a reach of approximately 2,000 miles at rank 20, sufficient to alter the environment of
an entire continent! This is a burst area effect by default.</p>
<p>Each of the following is a separate Environment effect. Note that Cold and Heat can only
simulate natural temperatures and don't cause damage.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-COLD">COLD</h3>
<p>You can lower the temperature in the area. For 1 point per rank, you create intense cold; for 2
points per rank, you create extreme cold.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-HEAT">HEAT</h3>
<p>You can raise the temperature in the area. For 1 point per rank, you create intense heat, for 2
points per rank; you create extreme heat.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-IMPEDE-MOVEMENT">IMPEDE MOVEMENT</h3>
<p>You can impede movement through the area with high winds, icy or wet surfaces, or similar
effects. For 1 point per rank, you reduce movement speed through the area by 1 rank; for 2 points per rank, you reduce
it by 2 ranks. Depending on your descriptors, you may also apply circumstance modifiers to Acrobatics and Athletics
checks for surface conditions.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-LIGHT">LIGHT</h3>
<p>You can raise the light level in the area, countering the concealment of darkness, but not
other forms of concealment. For 1 point per rank, you can create enough light to reduce total concealment to partial and
partial concealment to none. For 2 points per rank, you can shed light as bright as a sunlit day, eliminating all
concealment provided by natural darkness. Power effects with the darkness descriptor may be countered with a successful
power check (see <b>Countering Effects</b>).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-VISIBILITY">VISIBILITY</h3>
<p>You impose a -1 modifier to Perception checks for 1 point per rank, and a -2 for 2 points per
rank (see total <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-CONCEALMENT">Concealment</a>). For more significant obscuring
of senses (via darkness, fog, etc.) use an Area <a href="concealment-sensory.html">Concealment</a> Attack effect.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Selective</b>: With this extra you can vary the environment within your affected area,
affecting some while not affecting others, or even mixing and matching different environments (making part of the area
cold and another hot, for example). <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h2>
<p><b>Area</b>: This modifier is built in (at a difference cost) and can't be applied again
although you may change the area shape into another kind (it is burst by default).</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h2>
<p><b>Limited to Outdoor use only</b>: By default Environment can change the weather even indoors
but this limitation removes that ability. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
