<h1>Phantom Ranks</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: General &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226;
<b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 3 points per rank</span>
<p>You can temporarily make a power, chosen when you take this effect, more resistant to being
<a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countered</a>. While this effect is active, each rank in <b>Phantom Ranks</b>
counts as ranks for that power when performing a <a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-CHECKS">power check</a> to resist being
<a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countered</a>. This doesn't count for <a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-CHECKS">power
checks</a> used to <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">counter</a> another power,
<a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-CHECKS">power checks</a> against <a href="resistance.html">Resistance</a>, or any other
kind of <a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-CHECKS">power check</a>. The reason why a character would
buy <b>Phantom Ranks</b>
instead of simply more ranks of that power is because <b>Phantom Ranks</b> are not limited by power level limits. Some
effects have <b>Phantom Ranks</b> built in, such as having more than 4 ranks of <a href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a>,
in which case the <b>Phantom Ranks</b> are Permanent duration and
can't be modified. So, for example, <a href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> 7 allows you to become Incorporeal
but is harder to <a href="nullify.html">Nullify</a> than <a href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> 4 would be, on
the other hand you could also have
<a href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> 1 with 6 <b>Phantom Ranks</b> to become a fluid-like form and be equally
resistant to
<a href="nullify.html">Nullify</a> (or other <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countering</a> powers).</p>
