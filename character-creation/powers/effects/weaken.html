<h1>WEAKEN</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Attack &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</span>
<p>You can temporarily lower one of a target's traits, chosen when this effect is acquired. You
must touch the target, making a normal close attack check.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-WEAKEN-CHECK">WEAKEN CHECK</h3>
<span class="generated-class-2">Fortitude or Will vs. Weaken power check</span>
<p><b>Success</b>: No effect.</p>
<p><b>Failure</b>: The target loses character points from the affected trait equal to the
difference, up to a maximum of the <b>Weaken</b> rank.</p>
<p>Multiple failed defense checks against a <b>Weaken</b> effect are cumulative, up to a maximum of
the <b>Weaken</b> rank, at which point the effect cannot weaken the trait further. Lost points return at a rate of 1 per round
at the end of each of the target's turns. Inanimate objects do not recover weakened Toughness; they must be repaired.
Objects may or may not recover other weakened traits, at the GM's discretion and depending on the effect's
descriptors.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-WEAKENED-TRAITS">WEAKENED TRAITS</h3>
<p>Abilities weakened to a rank of -5 (which is the minimum) become debilitated. See <a href="../../abilities.html#TOC-DEBILITATED-ABILITIES">Debilitated Abilities</a> for
details of specific abilities at this point. Since -5 is the minimum any
further uses of <b>Weaken</b> on the subject have no effect until the ability recovers to a rank of at least -5.
Note that when an <a href="../../abilities.html">Ability</a> is changed <a href="../../skills.html">Skills</a> and
<a href="../../defenses.html#TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">Defenses</a> are affected.</p>
<p>Defenses have no lower limit and can be lowered below -5 (up to a maximum reduction equal to
your <b>Weaken</b> rank as normal). If an object's toughness is lower than its mass rank then it will break under its own
weight but will never be destroyed by it. Characters on the other hand are immune to this side effect regardless of
toughness and mass rank.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-WEAKENING-DEVICES">WEAKENING DEVICES</h3>
<p><b>Weaken</b> with Affects Objects and the right descriptor(s) can lower the traits provided by a
device (see the <b>Removable</b> flaw in <a href="../../gadgets-gear/index.html">Gadgets &amp; Gear</a>). For example,
<b>Weaken</b> Magic could potentially drain the powers of a magical device as well as a target's own magical powers. Likewise
<b>Weaken</b> Electricity could affect an electrical device, and so on. This also applies to equipment, although it tends to
have fewer traits to weaken, and the GM should feel free to disallow any <b>Weaken</b> effects that don't make reasonable
sense. For example, just because a <b>Weaken</b> <a href="damage.html">Damage</a> effect is possible doesn't mean a
character should be able to cause guns to do less damage; this sort of thing is better handled by an all-or-nothing
effect like <a href="nullify.html">Nullify</a>.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Affects Objects</b>: <b>Weaken</b> with this modifier works on inanimate objects, although the
effect can still only affect traits the objects possess. You can only affect a mass of rank 0 (50 lbs) for more see
<b>Increased Mass</b>. This is most often applied to <b>Weaken</b> Toughness for an effect that can weaken both creatures and
objects. <b>Objects Only: +0 points. Any Target: +1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Concentration</b>: Once you have hit with a Concentration <b>Weaken</b>, so long as you continue
to take a standard action each turn to maintain the effect, the target must make a new defense check against it, with
no attack check required. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Incurable</b>: <b>Weaken</b> with this modifier cannot have its effects countered by another power
(such as Restorative <b>Healing</b>) without the Persistent modifier; the target must recover from the <b>Weaken</b> normally. <b>Flat
+1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Precise</b>: A <b>Weaken</b> effect capable of reducing more than one trait at once can have this
modifier, allowing you to choose which traits are affected, while not affecting others. Note this differs from the
Selective extra (following). <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Progressive</b>: A Progressive <b>Weaken</b> effect reduces the affected traits each round until
the target successfully resists. The target makes a new defense check at the end of each of his turns; failure weakens the
affected trait(s) further, while success stops the Progressive <b>Weaken</b>, but the target must still recover ranks already
lost (at the rate of 1 point per round). <b>+2 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Selective</b>: This extra is applied to an Area <b>Weaken</b> so it only affects some targets and
not others. Combined with Precise (previously), you can use an Area <b>Weaken</b> to selectively affect only certain traits of
certain targets. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
