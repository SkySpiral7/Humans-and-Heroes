<h1>Nullify</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Attack &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Ranged &#8226;
<b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 3 points per rank</span>
<p><b>Nullify</b> can <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">counter</a> particular effects of a particular
<a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a>, such as fire effects,
magical effects, mental effects, technology effects, and so forth (see
<a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">Countering Effects</a>). The Gamemaster has
the final say if something is too broad such as mutant if all powers are mutant. You can
<a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">counter</a> one effect of your
chosen <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a> per use of <b>Nullify</b>. You can't apply
<a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-VARIABLE-DESCRIPTOR">Variable Descriptor</a> to this power.
You can't <b>nullify</b> <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-INNATE">innate</a> effects.</p>
<p><a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-READY---STANDARD-ACTION">Ready</a> an action to respond to the user of a power
or take a standard action to <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">counter</a> an ongoing effect.
When the <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countering</a> occurs make a ranged attack check to hit the target.
Then make an <a href="../../../gameplay/the-basics.html#TOC-OPPOSED-CHECKS">opposed check</a> of your <b>Nullify</b> rank
and the targeted effect's rank (as normal). You reduce the opponent's effect rank by your results. If your
result was higher or equal then the effect is canceled (or <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">"countered"</a>).
See <a href="index.html#TOC-COUNTERING-EFFECTS">countering effects</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="resistance.html">Resistance</a> to be immune to a power <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a>
rather than canceling the effect.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Aura</b>: If <b>Nullify</b> has an Area and an Aura (a Big Aura) then it will act as a barrier
against the chosen <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptors</a> automatically reducing effects when entering range.
In this case <b>Nullify</b> uses a routine check without rolling dice (although the opposing effect still might).
See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AURA">Aura</a> for cost and details.</p>
<p><b>Affects Insubstantial</b>: <b>Nullify</b> does not require this modifier to affect insubstantial
targets, or the <a href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> effect itself. You can attempt to <b>nullify</b> the
effects of insubstantial targets normally.</p>
<p><b>Area</b>: An Area <b>Nullify</b> effect works on all targets in the area. Make a single
<a href="index.html#TOC-POWER-CHECKS">power check</a>
and compare the result against the opposed checks of the targets. Targets lacking effects you can <b>nullify</b> are,
naturally, unaffected. Keep in mind that if you do not have the <b>Simultaneous</b> extra then each target must be using
the same power to be affected. For example if there are people using magic based <a href="flight.html">Flight</a> and people with magic
based <a href="protection.html">protection</a> both within range and you use <b>Nullify</b>: Magic to counter the
<a href="flight.html">Flight</a> then the <a href="protection.html">protected</a> ones will not be
affected unless you have <b>Simultaneous</b>. <b>See <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA">Area</a> for cost and
details.</b></p>
<p><b>Simultaneous</b>: Simultaneous <b>Nullify</b> can counter all effects of a particular <a href="../descriptors.html">descriptor</a>
(such as fire or magic) at once. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Precise</b>: If you can <b>Nullify</b> multiple effects, this modifier allows you to choose which
are nullified and which are not. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<p><b>Randomize</b>: Rather than being countered, the effect(s) targeted by your <b>Nullify</b> acquire
the Uncontrolled flaw and go out of control (as dictated by the GM). <b>+0 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Selective</b>: If you have an Area <b>Nullify</b> effect, this extra allows you to choose who in
the area is affected, <b>nullifying</b> some targets and not others. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Variable Descriptor</b>: You can't apply
<a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-VARIABLE-DESCRIPTOR">Variable Descriptor</a> to <b>Nullify</b>.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Side Effect</b>: If you fail to <b>nullify</b> an effect, you might suffer some kind of "backlash"
or similar side effect. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
