<div>Under the Hood: Complications and Up-Front Rewards</div>
<div>
<p>Some roleplaying game systems include complications, disadvantages, or similar problematic
character traits which offer "bonus points" for creating the character; essentially, you get more points for your
character's good traits when you take on some bad ones.</p>
<p>The problem with such "up-front" rewards for giving a character flaws is that the player gets
all of the reward (the bonus design points) immediately, but the disadvantage only occasionally limits or affects the
character, sometimes even randomly. Since there is only so much "screen time" in a game session, there is virtually no
way for the GM to spotlight every one of every character's disadvantages, so some end up being worth "more" in the sense
of reward in exchange for drawbacks. Plus, after they have "paid out" their initial benefit, front-loaded negative
traits are nothing but a burden to the character from that point forward, leading players to try and avoid or mitigate
them as much as possible.</p>
<p>Complications address this issue by having a "pay-as-you-go" approach: if the GM uses a
complication in the game, and the player responds by going along with it, the player gets a reward in the form of a
victory point. This means that although the hero has to deal with some "bad stuff" from time to time, there is an
upside, and a reason for players to want their characters' complications to come into play! Why do powerful heroes lead
such complicated lives? They need the points!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Comic books are full of storylines involving personal complications, and players are encouraged
to come up with some for their heroes. <b>Complications</b> have a specific use in the game as well: they give the
Gamemaster a "handle" on your hero, different challenges to introduce or include in adventures. When the GM does so, you
earn victory points you can use to enhance your character's chances of success, amongst other things. (See <b>Victory
Points</b> in <a href="../gameplay/the-basics.html">The Basics</a> and <a href="../gameplay/index.html">Gameplay Rules</a> for
more information.)</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CHOOSING-COMPLICATIONS">Choosing Complications</h2>
<p>Choose at least two complications for your hero: a motivation and another that is not. You can
take as many complications as you wish, although the GM may set limits for the sake of being able to keep track of them
all. Complications are also self-limiting, in that you only earn victory points for those complications that actually
come into play. So even if you have more than a dozen, if the GM can only include a couple in a game session, then those
are the ones that earn you victory points for that game. You can--and generally should--look for opportunities to
include your hero's complications and offer suggestions to the GM, who makes the final decision on which complications
come into play at any given time.</p>
<p>The GM also decides what complications are appropriate for the game and can overrule any
particular complication, based on the style and needs of the story and the series. Keep in mind the adventure needs to
have room for all of the heroes' complications, so individual ones can only come up so often.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="../examples/complications.html">example complications</a>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-MOTIVATION">Motivation</h2>
<p>Every hero has something that drove him or her to become a hero in the first place--a
motivation that keeps them going when things get tough. Sometimes motivation is the only difference between a hero and a
villain. What made your hero decide to fight for justice rather than turning toward more selfish goals? How does it
affect the hero's methods of fighting crime? Is there anything that might change or affect the hero's motivation?</p>
<p>Motivation is a complication because it often determines what a hero will do in a particular
situation. The GM can use your hero's motivation to encourage certain actions, and enemies may do the same. When you
properly play out your hero's motivation, if it isn't necessarily the "smartest" thing to do, the GM awards you a
victory point. No victory points are given out if following the motivation is a good idea since you would do that
anyway.</p>
<p>For example motivation complications see <a href="../examples/complications.html">example complications</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MOTIVATION-AND-INFLUENCE">Motivation And Influence</h3>
<p>A shared motivation can create an empathic bond with others. With the GM's permission, you
might get a circumstance bonus on interaction skill checks when dealing with someone with the same motivation as yours.
Similarly, you may suffer a circumstance penalty to interaction when dealing with characters of a strongly differing
motivation.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MOTIVATIONS-AS-DESCRIPTORS">Motivations As Descriptors</h3>
<p>At the GM's option motivation can function as a descriptor for powers (see <b>Descriptors</b>),
allowing character to have a power affecting only subjects with a particular motivation, for example, or the ability to
detect characters with a particular motivation (see <b>Detect</b>). Gamemasters should be very careful when applying
power modifiers based on subjective qualities like motivation. An attack power affecting only "evil" targets, for
example, is useless against inanimate objects, constructs, and animals (which cannot have such a quality) as well as
"good" targets. It might also not affect characters without a specific evil motivation (such as selfish mercenaries,
violent vigilantes, or despots devoted solely to order, but not "evil" per se).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MOTIVATIONS-AS-ORIGINS">Motivations As Origins</h3>
<p>Some characters may derive their powers from their motivation in some way, such as heroes who
draw strength from their convictions, faith, or morality. This provides a descriptor for those powers, but the hero may
also suffer Power Loss (see <b>Complications</b>) from a change or wavering in motivation.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-MOTIVATIONS-IN-CONFLICT">Motivations In Conflict</h3>
<p>A character with different motivations may find them in conflict from time to time. Such
conflicts provide roleplaying opportunities and complications for players and story hooks for the Gamemaster. For
example, a hero motivated by Patriotism may discover a secret government agency acting against the interests of justice
in the world. What is stronger, the hero's patriotism or the desire to see the truth known and justice done? Some
conflicts may even result in heroes changing motivations. See <b>Changing Complications</b>, in the following section,
for more on this.</p>

<div class="right-panel green-panel">
<div>Complications and Injuries</div>
<div>
<p>Various challenges heroes face over the course of a story make suitable complications. For
example, while the game rules don't have specific details for how to handle a hero with a concussion, it can make for an
interesting story. The easiest way to handle it is as a complication: whenever the injury causes the hero trouble (a
lost action due to dizziness, a villain getting away, etc.), the GM awards a victory point. You can do the same with
anything from a malfunctioning device to a persistent distraction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Complications can (and generally should) change over the course of a series: old enemies die or
are put away for good, rivalries and psychological issues are resolved, new romances and relationships begin as others
end, and so forth. Work with the GM to come up with new complications for your hero as old ones are resolved. As
mentioned previously, the Gamemaster may set limits as to how many ongoing complications your hero can have in play at
any given time.</p>
