<h1>Vehicles</h1>
<p>Not every hero can fly (or teleport, or run at super-speed...). Sometimes heroes make use of
other means to get around. Vehicles are used primarily for transportation, although they may come with additional
capabilities--including weapons--making them useful in other situations as well.</p>
<p>For examples see <a href="../../examples/gadgets-gear/vehicles.html">example vehicles</a>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-VEHICLE-TRAITS">Vehicle Traits</h2>
<p>Vehicles have the following traits: Size, Strength, Speed, Defense, and Toughness. Like
characters, each of a vehicle's traits costs points to improve. The basic cost for a vehicle is its Speed, but other
things, like the vehicle's ability to haul cargo or resist damage, cost points as well. Vehicles can even have power
effects of their own. Equipment point costs are summarized on <b>Table: Vehicle Trait Costs</b>.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-SIZE">Size</h3>
<p>A vehicle's size is measured in categories, as shown on <b>Table: Vehicle Size Categories</b>.
A vehicle's size determines its base Strength, Toughness, and Defense values. Vehicles start out at medium size by
default, and each increase in size category costs 5 equipment points.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STRENGTH">Strength</h3>
<p>A vehicle's Strength, much like a character's, determines its carrying capacity. You can
increase a vehicle's Strength over the base rank for its size for 1 equipment point per Strength rank.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-SPEED">Speed</h3>
<p>A vehicle buys the appropriate movement effect(s) for its Speed, paying the normal cost.
Vehicles with multiple modes of movement (air, ground, and water, for example) pay full cost for the most expensive and
can acquire the others as <a href="../powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT">Alternate Effects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DEFENSE">Defense</h3>
<p>A vehicle's size determines its base Defense. A vehicle's active defenses (Dodge since a vehicle doesn't
normally have Parry) are equal to the pilot's skill ranks in piloting with a maximum rank equal to the vehicle's Defense
rank which in this case represents maneuverability. For sizes larger than medium, base Defense is a penalty, making it easier to
target the vehicle. You can increase the Defense rank of a vehicle for 1 equipment point per +1 bonus.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</h3>
<p>Size category determines a vehicle's base Toughness rank, used for Toughness defense checks.
You can increase a vehicle's Toughness over the base rank for its size for 1 equipment point per Toughness rank.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FEATURES">Features</h3>
<p>Certain things are considered "standard" on any vehicle. These include seating, safety
harnesses or seat belts, heating and air-conditioning, radio receiver, headlights, and similar things with little or no
impact on game play. Features are "optional extras" for vehicles and cost 1 point each. The GM can determine if other
features are included in the vehicle or cost points. Some "features" are actually powers, described in the following
section.</p>
<p><b>Alarm</b>: The vehicle has an alarm system that goes off when an unauthorized access or
activation attempt is made. A Technology check (DC 10) can overcome the alarm. For each additional equipment point, the
DC increases by 2 to a maximum of DC 20.</p>
<p><b>Autopilot</b>: You get a built in computer that can make any kind of piloting decisions and
can improvise to the same degree as any person could. This acts like a minion with a pilot skill rank of 10 and a
navigation rank of 1 except it always makes routine checks (rolls an effective 0 on the dice) on any checks and it
doesn't know the location of anything unless it has a GPS or map (see <b>Navigation System</b> and <b>GPS</b> below).
For more advanced piloting buy a minion or sidekick (whether a computer construct or otherwise).</p>
<p><b>Caltrops</b>: A vehicle may be equipped with a dispenser for caltrops, spikes meant to
damage tired. Activating the dispenser is a standard action. Caltrops automatically blow out the tires of ordinary
vehicles that run over them (consider such vehicles minions in that they automatically fail by two degrees).
Heroes and villains can make DC 3 Toughness checks for
their vehicles; tires are Toughness 3. One degree of failure slows the vehicle, while two degrees of failure immobilize
it.</p>
<p><b>GPS</b>: see <a href="../../examples/gadgets-gear/general-equipment.html#TOC-SURVIVAL-GEAR">Gadgets and Gear</a>
for description but it costs 6 equipment points
total (5 points if you are replacing the navigation system below).</p>
<p><b>Hidden Compartments</b>: The vehicle has hidden compartments or cargo areas holding up to a
tenth of the vehicle's medium load in cargo. A Perception check (DC 10) allows the searcher to find the hidden
compartment. For each additional equipment point, the DC increases by 2 to a maximum of DC 30.</p>
<p><b>Navigation System</b>: The vehicle is equipped with a navigation system that grants a +2
circumstance bonus on skill checks related to navigation. The instruments included are such things like a map and
compass. This is built in to a GPS (see above) so that you could remove this before getting a GPS.</p>
<p><b>Oil Slick</b>: The vehicle can release an oil slick, covering a 20-ft. by 20-ft. area and
forcing the driver of a pursuing vehicle to make a Vehicles check (DC 5) to retain control of the vehicle. Releasing
the oil slick is a standard action.</p>
<p><b>Remote Control</b>: The vehicle's owner can operate it remotely using a transmitter and
control device. remotely controlling a vehicle requires the same kind of action (usually a move action) as if you were
actually behind the wheel of the vehicle.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWERS">Powers</h3>
<p>A vehicle can have power effects of its own, usually reflecting the vehicle's systems. Attack
effects are suitable for vehicle-mounted weapons, while defense effects protect the vehicle (and often the passengers)
from harm. Vehicle powers have their normal cost for the vehicle (meaning they cost one-fifth the normal amount for the
vehicle's owner, since the effects are incorporated into the vehicle and cost equipment points rather than Character
points).</p>
<p><b>Armor</b>: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addition to its normal Toughness,
possibly including Impervious Protection. Some vehicles may have Sustained Protection (such as force screens) instead
of, or in addition to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.</p>
<p><b>Cloaking Device</b>: A vehicle may have a "cloaking device" granting Concealment from visual
senses. Some vehicles may also have Concealment from auditory senses or things such as radar, giving them a "stealth
mode." 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense type) or 8 points (all visual senses).</p>
<p><b>Immunity</b>: Vehicles normally provide immunity to the normal hazards of environments they
travel through--such as underwater or in space--at no additional cost. Additional Immunity effects are for unusual
hazards or circumstances, such as a car that provides a sealed air system, granting immunity to suffocation and other
atmospheric hazards.</p>
<p><b>Smokescreen</b>: The vehicle can release a cloud of thick smoke or mist that provides an
Area visual Concealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pursuers. 12 points.</p>
<p><b>Weapons</b>: Vehicle weapons are based on various attack effects, particularly Damage with
various modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may mount versions of some of the weapons listed
elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SHARED-VEHICLES">Shared Vehicles</h2>
<p>A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole team, particularly useful for shuttling
around team members who cannot fly or move at super-speed. The members of the team divide the equipment point cost of
the vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the necessary ranks of the Equipment advantage to covering the
vehicle's cost.</p>
