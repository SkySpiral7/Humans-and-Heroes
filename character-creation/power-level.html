<h1>Power Level</h1>
<p><b>Power level</b> is an overall measure of effectiveness and power, primarily combat ability,
but also generally what sort of tasks a character can be expected to accomplish on a routine basis (see <b>Routine
Checks</b> in <a href="../gameplay/the-basics.html">The Basics</a>).</p>
<p>The minimum <b>power level</b> (for everyone) is 1 and there is no maximum.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">Power Level Limitations</h2>
<p><b>Power level</b> is a value set by the Gamemaster for the players. It places certain
limits on where and how players can spend <a href="character-points.html">Character points</a> when creating or improving
their heroes. <a href="advantages.html">Advantages</a> and all
modifiers (including circumstance) are included when determining <b>power level limitations</b>. <b>Power level</b> imposes the following limits:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> Rank</b>: Your hero's <a href="abilities.html">Ability</a> rank (including those from
<a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a>) cannot exceed the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a>
<b>power level</b> +10.
This is the same as most <a href="skills.html">skills</a> (see below).
This only applies to <a href="abilities.html#TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">Dexterity</a>,
<a href="abilities.html#TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">Intellect</a>, and <a href="abilities.html#TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">Awareness</a>
since they are the only ones that don't affect <a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-STRENGTH-AND-DAMAGE">unarmed Damage</a> or a
<a href="defenses.html">Defense</a>.
This doesn't apply to <a href="abilities.html#TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">Strength</a> (since
<a href="powers/effects/damage.html#TOC-STRENGTH-AND-DAMAGE">unarmed Damage</a> is covered by
"<a href="powers/effects/index.html">Effect</a> rank of an Attack"), <a href="abilities.html#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility</a> (since <a
href="defenses.html#TOC-DODGE">Dodge</a> is covered by "<a href="defenses.html">Defense</a> Modifier"),
<a href="abilities.html#TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">Fighting</a> (since <a href="defenses.html#TOC-PARRY">Parry</a> is covered by
"<a href="defenses.html">Defense</a> Modifier"),
<a href="abilities.html#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a> (since <a href="defenses.html#TOC-FORTITUDE">Fortitude</a> and
<a href="defenses.html#TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</a>
are covered by "<a href="defenses.html">Defense</a> Modifier"), and <a href="abilities.html#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a>
(since <a href="defenses.html#TOC-WILL">Will</a> is covered by "<a href="defenses.html">Defense</a> Modifier").</li>
<li><b>Combat <a href="skills.html">Skill</a> Modifier</b>: Your hero's total modifier (<a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html">advantage</a> modifiers, etc)
of both <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> and
<a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged Combat</a>
cannot exceed the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> <b>power level</b>. This is the same as the attack limit (see below).</li>
<li><b>Every other <a href="skills.html">Skill</a> Modifier</b>: Your hero's total modifier (<a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html">advantage</a> modifiers, etc)
with any skill except <a href="skills.html#TOC-CLOSE-COMBAT">Close Combat</a> and
<a href="skills.html#TOC-RANGED-COMBAT">Ranged Combat</a> (see above)
cannot exceed the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> <b>power level</b> +10. This includes untrained
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> modifiers using
only <a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank, and so sets an effective limit on all <a href="abilities.html">abilities</a>
since each is associated with at least 1 <a href="skills.html">skill</a> (see above).</li>
<li><b>Attack Modifier</b>: Your hero's total attack bonus (from <a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="skills.html">skill</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html">advantage</a> modifiers,
<a href="powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-ACCURATE">accurate</a> extra ranks, etc)
cannot exceed the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> <b>power level</b>.</li>
<li><b><a href="powers/effects/index.html">Effect</a> rank of an Attack</b>: Your hero's
<a href="powers/effects/index.html">effect</a> rank of an attack <a href="powers/effects/index.html">power</a>
cannot exceed the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> <b>power level</b>.</li>
<li><b><a href="defenses.html">Defense</a> Modifier</b>: Each of your hero's <a href="defenses.html">defenses</a>
cannot have a total that exceeds the <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> <b>power level</b>.
This includes <a href="abilities.html">ability</a> rank,
<a href="powers/effects/protection.html">protection</a> rank, <a href="advantages.html#TOC-DEFENSIVE-ROLL">defensive roll</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <b>power level limitations</b> are global so that if for any reason a number total would exceed
the maximum then it is instead reduced to the maximum permitted. <b>Power level limitations</b> can't be trumped by other rules,
however since <b>power level</b> is character specific, two allies may have different capabilities. One reason <b>power level limitations</b>
are like this is to prevent an <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait</a> that
<a href="powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AFFECTS-OTHERS">Affects Others</a> from making someone more powerful than
the player's normal limits (<b>power level</b> can't be increased by any <a href="powers/effects/index.html">effect</a>).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-WEAK-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Weak Player Characters</h2>
<p>The GM may want to keep an eye out for very low <a href="defenses.html#TOC-TOUGHNESS">toughness</a> or attack.
For the most part, these designs are self-limiting, but they can pose problems in comparison to better-balanced characters.
A player might not know how useless an <a href="powers/effects/index.html">effect</a> with low attack is until later. A player be thinking
"it'll be rare but when it hits: you better watch out" then after several battles without landing a single attack
will regret the idea. That would be a good time to allow <a href="character-points.html#TOC-REALLOCATING-CHARACTER-POINTS">point
reallocation</a> but you can save time by watching out
for it when initially making a character.</p>
<p>Unusually low <a href="defenses.html#TOC-TOUGHNESS">toughness</a>, on the other hand, is a different gamble.
A player may think "I'll be a regular human with great <a href="gadgets-gear/index.html">equipment</a>" wanting to be the
underdog or Batman or something.
But if his friends all have high <a href="defenses.html#TOC-TOUGHNESS">toughness</a> and they all fight against a villain
with high <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a>...
No one wants the character they made to die in a single hit and it might be hard for a GM to manage fights
with people with very different combat abilities. Don't put too much faith into
<a href="defenses.html#TOC-PARRY">Parry</a>/<a href="defenses.html#TOC-DODGE">Dodge</a> because: there's
always a 4% change you'll fail, Perception range always hits, and the <a href="../gameplay/conditions.html">conditions</a>
Vulnerable and Defenseless
(which can be caused by a surprise round or other circumstances) lower/eliminate <a href="defenses.html#TOC-ACTIVE-DEFENSES">active defenses</a>.
And don't put too much faith in staying out of range: the villain might have Perception range effects or other tricks.
Admittedly some of these things wouldn't happen accidentally but everyone probably wants to be able to participate in the battle
and not "we'll handle this while you sit in the corner for the next few minutes" (which is also the problem with low
attack, low <a href="powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a>, and an unbalanced team in general).</p>
<p>How little is too little? The problem is about inconsistency and not about specific numbers.
If the entire team has <a href="defenses.html#TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</a> 5 then challenges can be made accordingly even
if that's well below the maximum for the
<b>power level</b>. A human with <a href="skills.html">skills</a>, <a href="advantages.html">advantages</a>, and
<a href="gadgets-gear/index.html">equipment</a> can help out his superpowered friends but if his friends are
too strong they'll be out of his league in combat. He might end up being utility only: "you handle skill checks and we'll do
everything else" which can still be fun in certain circumstances as long as everyone has realistic expectations.
As an example when Batman and Superman team up against Darkseid (all 3 from DC Comics) Batman can't fight Darkseid
so he does something else instead such as hack into Darkseid's base.</p>
