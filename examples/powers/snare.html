<h1>SNARE</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: Ranged, Cumulative <a
href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/affliction.html">Affliction</a>, Extra Condition, Limited Degree (2 degrees) &#8226;
<b>3 points per rank</b></span>
<p>You can restrain a target with bonds of ice, glue, webbing, bands of energy, and so forth
(whatever suits your descriptors). The target makes a Dodge defense check against your effect DC. One degree of
failure leaves the target hindered and vulnerable, while two results in the target becoming defenseless and immobilized.
There is no additional effect for three or more degrees of failure.</p>
<p>The defense check to break out of a Snare is based on <a
href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a> (including Strength Damage) or Sleight of Hand, either
breaking the effect or slipping out of it. This is part of the power's Alternate Resistance, with no change in
cost.</p>
