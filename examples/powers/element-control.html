<h1>Element Control</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: Perception Ranged Move Object, Limited to Element <b>&#8226; 2 points per
rank</b></span>
<p>You can control and move a mass of an element like air, earth, or water. Your power's effective
Strength equals its rank, which is also the <a href="../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight rank</a> of the element
you can move at once. So Earth Control 11 lets you
move up to <a href="../../gameplay/ranks-and-measures.html">weight rank</a> 11 of earth and stone, for example.</p>
<p>Element Control is further refined with various Alternate Effects (see <b>Alternate
Effects</b>), expanding what you can do with your control. So Earth Control might let you kick up clouds of dust (Area
Visual <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/concealment.html">Concealment</a> Attack), build walls and other
structures of rock (Continuous Create), tunnel through the ground (<a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/permeate.html">Permeate</a>),
or fly standing on a chunk
of rock (Platform <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/flight.html">Flight</a>), to name a few. Alternate Effects
you do not add to your power as full-fledged modifiers are still available to you as power stunts using extra effort
(see <b>Powers Stunts</b>).</p>
