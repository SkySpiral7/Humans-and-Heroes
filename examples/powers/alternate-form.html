<h1>ALTERNATE FORM</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: Varies, Activation <b>effects total -1 or 2 points</b></span>
<p>You can transform into something other than mere flesh and blood, from a body of organic steel
to a cloud of gas, a mass of liquid, a swarm of tiny insect-sized robots, or anything else you want to develop. Choose a
set of effects that reflect the capabilities of your Alternate Form, based on the examples following. Then choose the
action required to assume your Alternate Form: if it requires a move action, subtract 1 character point from the total
cost of the effects. If it requires a standard action, subtract 2 points. See the <b>Activation</b> flaw for
details.</p>
<p>Some potential Alternate Forms (and their possible effects) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Energy</b>: You are made up of energy, such as fire or electricity: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage-attack.html">Damage</a>
   (close or ranged), <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/flight-movement.html">Flight</a>, <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity-defense.html">Immunity</a>,

<li><b>Heroic</b>: You have a distinct "hero" form, in addition to your "normal" form. Essentially, all your powers have the
