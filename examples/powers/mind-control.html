<p>Please enable JavaScript in order to see the generated sidebar.
Without it you'll have to use the <a href="../../site-map.html">sitemap</a> in order easily navigate.</p>

<p>sideBar.js is harmless: it simply generates hyperlinks to major pages. It exists in a single place so that
I don't have to update 100+ html pages with relative links whenever I want to change it.</p>

href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/affliction.html">Affliction</a>, Resisted by Will &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 5 points per
rank</span>
<p>You can impose your will on others, forcing them to obey your commands. Targets failing a Will
defense check against your effect DC first become dazed, then compelled, as they try to fight off your influence.
Finally, with three or more degrees of effect, the target becomes controlled and obeys any commands you give.</p>
<p>Degrees of failure on defense checks against Mind Control are cumulative. You can also apply
the Progressive modifier (see <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/affliction.html">Affliction</a> effect) so your
mental hold increases each time the target fails a defense check against it!</p>
