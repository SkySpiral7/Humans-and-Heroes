<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/growth.html">Growth</a> without
Strength, Stamina, or size bonuses <b>&#8226; 3 points per rank</b></span>
<p>This is Growth for mass only. This is useful for resisting Trip attempts for example: you get a
+1 to resist Trip attempts per mass rank increase.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h2>
<p><b>Unmovable</b>: Instead of gaining mass you only gain the inertia of increased mass. So that
you are as hard to move or trip as if you were heavy but without damaging any floor you stand on (rather your weight is
unchanged by using the power). <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
