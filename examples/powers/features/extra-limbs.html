<h3>Under the Hood: Extra Limbs Not Extra Actions</h3>
<div>
<p>As a default, <b>Extra Limbs</b> do not grant characters the ability to take extra actions in a
round, simply because multiple actions--especially extra standard actions usable for attacks--tend to slow down and
unbalance play.</p>
<p>As an option for including some combat benefits with Extra Limbs, consider allowing the
application of the Multiattack extra to the Strength of a character with Extra Limbs, reflecting the ability to launch a
flurry of attacks at a single opponent, or to "spread" those attacks among a number of nearby opponents. See
<b>Multiattack</b> description under <b>Extras</b> for details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You have extra manipulative limbs, such as arms, tentacles, or even prehensile hair or a tail.
Each rank in this effect grants you an extra limb.</p>
<p>Extra Limbs do not allow you to take additional actions in a round, although they do provide
the benefits of the Improved Grab advantage--grabbing with some of your limbs and leaving others free. All additional
limbs except your dominant limb are considered your "off-hand." If you have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you
have no off-hand penalties with any of your limbs.</p>
<p>If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than taking the option to leave some
of them free), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus at rank 1 in Extra Limbs and an additional +1 (for a maximum of +2)
at rank 4. Using all of your limbs for a grab attempt like this is considered a <b>team check</b> and therefore
can't get a further bonus.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p>In general, modifiers affecting attack effects (e.g. Affects Corporeal, Area, Penetrating,
etc.) should apply to the Strength of a character with Extra Limbs rather than to the Extra Limbs effect itself. Such
modifiers applied to Strength affect all of the character's limbs.</p>
<p><b>Projection</b>: Your Extra Limbs are merely a projection of your power rather than an
extension of your body. therefore, any harm directed specifically against your Extra Limb(s) has no effect. So, for
example, one of your additional limbs could reach into a container of acid or a blast furnace to pull out an object
without any harm to you. The GM may require Extra Limbs with this extra to modify their duration to continuous or
sustained, but this is not essential. It's likely Extra Limbs with this extra are not eligible for the Innate modifier.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Distracting</b>: Coordinating the actions of your multiple limbs is difficult, so you are
vulnerable while applying any extra limbs to an action. This flaw should generally not apply to any creature with Innate
Extra Limbs, especially if they are part of its natural physiology. See <a
href="../../../character-creation/powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-DISTRACTING">Flaws</a> for more details. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
