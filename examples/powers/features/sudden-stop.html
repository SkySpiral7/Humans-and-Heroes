<p>Please enable JavaScript in order to see the generated sidebar.
Without it you'll have to use the <a href="../../../site-map.html">sitemap</a> in order easily navigate.</p>

<p>sideBar.js is harmless: it simply generates hyperlinks to major pages. It exists in a single place so that
I don't have to update 100+ html pages with relative links whenever I want to change it.</p>

<h1>Sudden Stop</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../../../character-creation/powers/effects/feature.html">Feature</a> &#8226;
<b>Action</b>: Move &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per
rank</span>
<p>You can stop on a dime: going from any speed to completely stopped in a single action. You must
be capable of moving to use this power so that <b>Flight</b> is required for someone who is falling and a person who is
immobile can't stop himself. You can't use this power while you are being dragged or carried: you must first escape the
grab. The action this feature takes ignores the action your movement would take and ignores your maximum speed. This
feature is not considered a movement power and thus is allowed to have an action of free.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Mobility Independent</b>: You may use this power at any time except while being grabbed.
This extra allows you to stop in mid-air without <b>Flight</b> even while immobile. However you must still escape a grab
before you are able to use it and you must still be able to take the action required. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
