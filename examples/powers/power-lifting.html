<p>Your lifting and carrying capacity is out of proportion with the rest of your Strength. Each
rank in this power gives you +1 to your Strength rank for determining how much weight you can lift and carry, but does
not increase your Strength-based <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage-attack.html">damage</a>, strength checks (including skills) except
for lifting, or other effects of your Strength rank.</p>
<p>Since this doesn't increase <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage-attack.html">damage</a> it is not limited by the <b>Attack &amp; Effect</b>
limitation but is still limited by <b>Skill Modifier</b> as described in <a href="../../character-creation/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>.</p>
