<p>Please enable JavaScript in order to see the generated sidebar.
Without it you'll have to use the <a href="../../site-map.html">sitemap</a> in order easily navigate.</p>

<p>sideBar.js is harmless: it simply generates hyperlinks to major pages. It exists in a single place so that
I don't have to update 100+ html pages with relative links whenever I want to change it.</p>

<h1>Power-lifting</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: Limited <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait: Strength</a> &#8226;
<b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per
rank</span>
<p>Your lifting and carrying capacity is out of proportion with the rest of your Strength. Each
rank in this power gives you +1 to your Strength rank for determining how much weight you can lift and carry, but does
not increase your Strength-based <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a>, strength checks (including skills) except
for lifting, or other effects of your Strength rank.</p>
<p>Since this doesn't increase <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage.html">damage</a> it is not limited by the "Effect rank of an Attack"
limitation but is still limited by "Every other Skill Modifier" as described in
<a href="../../character-creation/power-level.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level limitations</a>.</p>
