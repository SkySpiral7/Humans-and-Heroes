<h1>ELONGATION</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/growth.html">Growth</a> without
Strength, Stamina, or mass bonuses <a href="../../character-creation/powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-LINKED">Linked</a>
with <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/morph.html">Morph</a> &#8226; <b>3 points per rank +1 flat point</b></span>
<p>You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your reach. This
<a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/growth.html">Growth</a> only changes your size.
<a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/morph.html">Morph</a> (1 rank) is required so that your size does not need to be
proportional. This doesn't allow you to <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/shrinking.html">shrink</a> below your
normal size. See <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/growth.html">Growth</a> for the benefits of changing
size.</p>
<p>You can use <b>Elongation</b> to make "close" ranged attacks at a greater distance by
elongating your limbs. Once elongated, you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a standard action. If you
can't accurately sense your target (you're elongating around a corner, for example), apply the rules for concealment
(see <a href="../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-CONCEALMENT">Gameplay Rules: Concealment</a>). In addition,
<b>Elongation</b> allows you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a +1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by
PL).</p>
