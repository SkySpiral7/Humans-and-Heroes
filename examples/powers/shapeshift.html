<h1>Shapeshift</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/variable.html">Variable</a>, Move Action &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 9 points per rank</span>
<p>You can transform into different forms, gaining the physical traits (abilities, skills,
advantages, and powers) of the assumed form. You gain (Shapeshift rank x 5) character points worth of traits. You are
limited to the inherent traits of the forms you assume this includes the ability to gain new mental traits if that form
possesses them.</p>
<p>Shapeshift uses Variable which requires a limitation such as by the specific types of forms the
character can assume, such as Limited to Animals or Limited to Machines.</p>
<p>Note that this example power does not include a linked <a
href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/morph.html">Morph</a> meaning that you do not look any different when
shapeshifting. <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/growth.html">Growth</a> and <a
href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/shrinking.html">Shrinking</a> on the other hand must be purchased using the
Variable points since the form you are turning into had bought them. Turning into a Hawk for example would require you
to use some of those Variable points on Shrinking since the Hawk has a permanent Shrinking. For a short
list of animals see <a href="../../examples/characters/animals/index.html">example animals</a>.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="mimic.html">Mimic</a> for duplicating the traits of another character.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Aura</b>: Although this isn't an attack, a limited version of Aura can be applied to shapeshift.
The power must be Personal range with an action of Standard. The action type becomes reaction (as normal).
When touched you lose the powers of your previous subject
and must spend points to mimic the new subject. You may spend points in any order you like but must continue
spending them until there is nothing left you can buy. Note that this includes being touched by a subject without
powers. You can end the duration of shapeshift as normal but activation is required when touched unless it is also <b>Selective</b>.
If multiple subjects are touching you at the same time then you may chose which one to mimic.
The effect is otherwise the same except that "Big Aura" isn't allowed and the cost is different.
See <a href="../../character-creation/powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AURA">Aura</a> for details. <b>-1 cost per rank</b></p>
