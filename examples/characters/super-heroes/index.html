<p>The following example characters are ready to play for a power level 10 series. Some require a few
simple choices or offer options for customization. Gamemasters can also use these archetypes as ready-made villains, if
desired.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-MAKING-THE-MOST-OF-ADVANTAGES">Making The Most Of Advantages</h2>
<p>The <a href="gadgeteer.html">Gadgeteer</a> and <a href="martial-artist.html">Martial Artist</a> archetypes rely a great deal on their advantages (as do other
archetypes like the <a href="crime-fighter.html">Crime Fighter</a>). You'll want to read the descriptions of all of the character's
advantages from <a href="../../../character-creation/advantages.html">Advantages</a> so you know the benefits they provide. Remember to make use
of them during play to give your character every appropriate, well, advantage.</p>
<p>In particular, note how some advantages and even powers work together. The <a href="gadgeteer.html">Gadgeteer</a> can use
Quick-Thinking to speed up the process of inventing (see <a href="../../../character-creation/gadgets-gear/index.html#TOC-INVENTING">Inventing</a>)
and <a href="../../../character-creation/advantages.html#TOC-SKILL-MASTERY">Skill Mastery (Technology)</a> to make some
inventing checks as routine. Similarly, note the <a href="martial-artist.html">Martial Artist</a>'s
<a href="../../../character-creation/advantages.html#TOC-POWER-ATTACK">Power Attack</a> advantage, good for doing extra damage to
slow, tough, opponents, and the <a href="../../../character-creation/advantages.html#TOC-SKILL-MASTERY">Skill Mastery (Acrobatics)</a>
advantage for pulling off formidable (DC 15) Acrobatics checks
as routine!</p>
<h2 id="TOC-KNOW-YOUR-OPTIONS">Know Your Options</h2>
<p>The <a href="mimic.html">Mimic</a> and <a href="shapeshifter.html">Shapeshifter</a> archetypes are both very flexible,
although in different ways, and it pays
to know what your character is capable of doing before you are immersed in the midst of a game.</p>
<p>In the case of the <a href="mimic.html">Mimic</a>, the GM may wish to put together note cards or some other quick
reference to the powers of other characters whom the <a href="mimic.html">Mimic</a> might wish to duplicate. That way, you can see at a glance
what traits the character can copy, and simply hand the card to the player for reference. Experienced Mimics may even
build up a "hand" of such cards they reference often.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-FUN-WITH-STRENGTH">Fun With Strength</h2>
<p>The <a href="paragon.html">Paragon</a> and <a href="powerhouse.html">Powerhouse</a> archetypes are among the strongest archetypes, able to lift and
carry a lot of weight. Just to give you an idea, the <a href="paragon.html">Paragon</a> can lift a loaded 747 aircraft, whereas the
<a href="powerhouse.html">Powerhouse</a> can lift four times that amount.
Both can easily smash through stone or bend steel.</p>
<p>Both archetypes are pretty tough, too. With their 6 ranks of Impervious Toughness, both can
shrug off the damage of most conventional weapons, including guns, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers, without even
having to make a defense check! It would take the equivalent of an exploding shell to penetrate their skin.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-FAST-FACTS">Fast Facts</h2>
<p>In addition to formidable ground speed, and the ability to run across water or up sheer
surfaces, the <a href="speedster.html">Speedster</a>'s Quickness rank allows opportunities to do a lot in a short span of time. A Speedster subtracts
10 from the time rank required to accomplish any routine task, doing in six seconds what it takes most people two hours
to accomplish! That can include reading, fixing things, or searching an area, just to name a few.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-HIGHER-AND-LOWER-POWER-LEVEL-ARCHETYPES">Higher And Lower Power Level Archetypes</h2>
<p>The archetypes presented here can serve as models for higher and lower power level versions
suitable for different series, ranging from as low as PL8 (PL6 for some archetypes) to as high as PL15 or more.
Reworking an archetype for a different power level requires rebuilding the character to ensure everything matches the
power level limits, but here are some quick guidelines for modifying an archetype on the fly. They are particularly
useful if the Gamemaster wants a character of a different power level for a game, but doesn't want to go through the
trouble of creating the character from scratch:</p>
<p>For every +1 power level, increase the archetype's attack bonuses, defenses, and skill ranks by
1. Also increase the archetype's powers offering a defense check by 1 rank. If desired, shift an increase to a trait
you don't want to go any higher to the corresponding trait in a pair, such as applying an attack increase to power rank,
or a Toughness increase to either Dodge or Parry.</p>
<p>For every -1 power level, decrease the archetype's attack bonuses, defenses, and skill ranks by
1. Also decrease the archetype's powers offering defense checks by 1 rank each. You can likewise shift a decrease
from a trait you want to keep at its present rank to the corresponding trait in a pair, like applying an attack decrease
to power rank, or a Dodge decrease to Toughness.</p>
<p>Check to see that none of the character's traits exceed the new power level limits and add up
the character's new Character point cost. If you are creating a starting character for that power level (rather than a
non-player character), adjust the total Character point cost to match the recommended starting total, adding or removing
traits as needed.</p>
