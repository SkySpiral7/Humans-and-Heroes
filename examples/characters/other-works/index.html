<h1>Example Converted Characters</h1>
<p>This page contains examples of characters that are based on material I don't own and it will be labeled where it is from.</p>
<p>Note that there are plenty of characters who have already been converted into M&amp;M 3e the most popular/biggest one
is <a href="http://www.atomicthinktank.com/viewforum.php?f=14">The Atomic Think Tank Forum: Roll Call</a> but there's also
<a href="http://mmconversions.wikidot.com/">Mutants &amp; Masterminds Conversions wikidot</a>. Note that people
tend to fall victim to the snafu of meaningless numbers and make the character PL 10. Even if you picked a strength for
Superman (DC comics) to be consistent with, that number shouldn't be anywhere near PL 10.</p>
<p>Below is a list of full character sheets. The links will load the character into the <a href="../../../character-creation/point-counter.html">point counter</a> for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../character-creation/point-counter.html?includeJsCharacterFile=..%2Fexamples%2Fcharacters%2Fother-works%2Fjs%2FMewtwo.js">Mewtwo</a> from "Pok&eacute;mon: The First Movie"</li>
