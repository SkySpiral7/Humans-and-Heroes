<h1>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS</h1>
<p>This page is a landing point for example characters. Some of them such as those under <a href="super-heroes/index.html">super heroes</a>
are intended to be used by players (after choosing some options). Some of them such as <a href="constructs/index.html">constructs</a>
are more intended for NPCs or sidekicks. Finally some of them are converted from <a href="other-works/index.html">other sources</a>.</p>
