<h1>Example Series Frameworks</h1>
<p>The follow <a href="../gamemastering/series.html">series</a> frameworks provide the Gamemaster with some ideas and models for running a
series in a variety of different styles, from high-powered heroes safeguarding the world to people with no powers but a
lot of determination working to try and make their corner of the world a better place. Each framework has a summary of
what the series is about, what sort of characters are suited to it, and some ideas to get you going.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-LEGACIES">Legacies</h2>
<span class="info-banner">
<b>Power Level</b>: 8-10 &#8226; <b>Scale</b>: Local &#8226; <b>Setting</b>: Modern &#8226; <b>Style</b>: Grayscale</span>
<p>You've known each other all your lives, played together as kids, were always visiting each
other's homes with your parents, and had pretty good lives together. Now you've discovered each of you has...
exceptional abilities and have decided, either independently, or as a group, to become heroes! Do you have what it takes
to work as a team? What do you do when all of your parents disappear at the same time? How do you deal with learning
they're actually longtime heroes... or villains?</p>
<h2 id="TOC-HOME-FRONT-HEROES">Home-front Heroes</h2>
<span class="info-banner">
<b>Power Level</b>: 7-9 &#8226; <b>Scale</b>: Regional &#8226; <b>Setting</b>: Historical &#8226; <b>Style</b>: Light</span>
<p>America is threatened by the growing threat of the Axis powers. President Roosevelt sends a
number of the well-known heroes across the globe to save American soldiers and perform special operations. Wisely, he
also asks a number of rookie heroes to handle some important jobs, on the home-front and abroad, but also behind the
scenes. Does your two-fisted hero have the guts to pass up the glory of answering the President's call to serve a higher
cause?</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ANSWERING-THE-CALL">Answering The Call</h2>
<span class="info-banner">
<b>Power Level</b>: 10-12 &#8226; <b>Scale</b>: Global &#8226; <b>Setting</b>: Modern &#8226; <b>Style</b>: Grayscale</span>
<p>The local big-league super-team has disbanded; they might even be missing and presumed dead
after another titanic battle to save the city. But the city needs its heroes, so it's up to a new group of heroes to
take up the mantle and the responsibility to defend the city from threats too great for any one of them to handle.
Rebuilding the team is no small task, nor is winning the trust of the city, and you can bet the old team's foes will
waste no time in taking advantage of the situation. Do your heroes have what it takes to create a team of their own?
What happens if they do and the previous team returns?</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ACROSS-THE-MULTIVERSE">Across The Multiverse</h2>
<span class="info-banner">
<b>Power Level</b>: 12-15 &#8226; <b>Scale</b>: Multiversal &#8226; <b>Setting</b>: The multiverse &#8226; <b>Style</b>: Grayscale</span>
<p>In the wake of multiversal threats, including the machinations of powerful extradimensional
beings, a mysterious organization has instituted a program of recruiting agents from across the various worlds. They
take only the most capable, forming a powerful alliance to protect the multiverse from terrible threats and keep their
timeline untangled. The characters come from many alternate worlds, but team up to keep all worlds safe, assuming the
organization they work for is being entirely truthful with them...</p>
