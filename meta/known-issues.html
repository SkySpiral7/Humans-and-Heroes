<p><b>Known limitations</b>. This system only works for building single characters. It sucks at building armies, cities,
and machines that multiple people built. There are also some known holes, that is things that are not covered by these
rules, such as a sword of dragon slaying (although I have an idea for that).</p>
<p><b>Snafu</b>. I changed the game to use 3dF for several reasons (see <a href="change-explanation.html#TOC-DICE-CHANGE">Dice Change</a>)
one of which is the ranks and measurements
table. And while this is a step in the right direction it's now a little inconsistent with DCs. Each unit of ability,
skill, or power etc represents a double effectiveness however DC 4 is not beyond the best of human achievement.
While it makes sense for powers to double in effectiveness (to fight against the law of diminishing return and because they
are all superhuman) it doesn't make sense for skills: every rank counts towards a DC and is therefore useful
but human achievement is measured with more granularity than 2^n. Thus the only solution is to declare
that powers double but skills don't and give them separate rank/measurement tables. This would require a complete overhaul
(and thus be version 4.0) and although it might not require much conversion the implications are massive and thus
requires a lot of consideration and planning.</p>
<p><b>Snafu</b>: equipment damage. Currently all of the Damage ranks that equipment have were determined by
Mutants &amp; Masterminds 3rd edition. The Police baton and Holdout Pistol both have Damage 2.
In what world does the M&amp;M author live in where that makes any sense? Simple: a world designed for superheroes and not
equipment. Guns are weak so that we can see swords and stuff in use and not just a bunch of guns.
The first problem with trying to fix this is just that: if guns are 5 times cheaper why not buy them?
The second problem is that it's hard to determine how much damage things should be. "Guns can 1 hit a normal human
so they should do 6 HP of damage on average" ok but what about a rocket launcher? You can't just say "would kill a normal
human exactly 3 times over" because that can't be measured. So you'll need difficult estimates that will likely be based
on the rank snafu above.</p>
<p><b>Balance</b>. <a href="../gamemastering.html#TOC-GODHOOD">Transcendence</a> needs an overhaul: some are very broken
and the rest are too cheap. Except <a href="../powers/effects/godhood/alter-metaphysics-control.html">Alter Metaphysics</a>
which is perfect (after some rewording).</p>
<p><b>Useless</b>. A <a href="../powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-SELECTIVE">Selective</a> <a href="../powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AREA-SHAPE">Burst Area</a>
is strictly better than selective areas: cylinder and cone.</p>
<p><b>Limitation</b>. I tried to replace the modifiers <b>Affects Others</b>, <b>Attack</b>, and <b>Activation</b> with an <b>Enhanced Trait</b>
that provides a power. But I wasn't able to because I couldn't figure out how to handle the cost of a Continuous <b>Enhanced Trait</b>: Portal <b>Teleport</b>.
The limitation is that you can't modify the action of <b>Affects Others</b> and you can't use <b>Affects Others</b> on attacks.</p>
