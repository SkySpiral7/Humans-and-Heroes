<p>The average sum is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.414.</p>
<p>As the above data shows, the chance of getting a critical success or failure is about 4% each
(1/27). The chance of getting a 0 is about 26% (7/27) but the chance of getting at least 0 is about 63% (17/27)
therefore it is usually better to roll then it is to take a routine check.</p>

<p>The statistics of a contested roll are more complex. Because of criticals, I can't simply calculate
that statistics for 6dF. Likewise I don't know the frequency of each result and I haven't calculated standard deviation.</p>

<p>A specific and useful application of contested rolls is a <a href="../powers/effects/damage-attack.html">Damage</a>
power check. The chance of success is defined by doing at least 0 damage, that is to say the chance of inflicting a tenderized
penalty. The statistics can be applied for any rank of <a href="../powers/effects/damage-attack.html">Damage</a> or Toughness.
For example <a href="../powers/effects/damage-attack.html">Damage</a> 10 vs Toughness 5 is a toughness difference of -5
which has a 97.35% that the attacker will succeed.</p>
<p>Note that these numbers can be applied to any contested roll involving traits however the chances
assume that there is no automatic success or failure and that you will succeed in the case of a tie. If you lose from a
tie then treat your opponent's trait as 1 higher. For example if you are rolling an <a href="../powers/effects/affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>
5 power check against a Fortitude of 10 then your chance of success is 2.65%.</p>
