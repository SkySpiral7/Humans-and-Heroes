<p>This section contains information about the game itself (such as author commentary and known issues) rather than rules for the game.</p>
<p><b>Mission Statement:</b> The purpose of this system is to provide a universal system (more so than GURPS)
that will allow any character from any story to be created in a balanced way. This will allow you to have an ultimate
showdown of ultimate destiny by simply making character sheets for each of them. The ideals in order are: balance, versatility,
then simplicity. It is possible that simplicity is sacrificed for the sake of versatility (if the trade off is reasonable)
although if too complex it may end up in the <a href="../gamemastering/supplementary-rules.html">Supplementary Rules</a> rather than the core.</p>
<p>(As a disclaimer I only flipped through a GURPS character creation book and read the basic rules but haven't actually played it
or seen the Superhero rules). H&amp;H is already infinitely more versatile then GURPS simply because H&amp;H has building blocks
which let you have any combination. So if you want radioactive flaming hornets to shoot from your hands:
<a href="../examples/powers/blast.html">Ranged Damage</a> it's as simple as that but GURPS doesn't have such
an ability. And as you can see this is also more simple: using a couple basic powers is far easier than trying to search
through an entire GURPS book full of "every spell we could think of". The entire rules of H&amp;H can fit within
the number of pages it takes GURPS to list every character advantage, and H&amp;H is still more versatility. Clearly
complexity isn't an issue. Also the <a href="../character-creation/powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a> power
helps highlight that your character doesn't need 12 different ways of dealing damage.</p>
<p>Although this system can create
ANY character (minus the known limitations) some characters in their source material are not consistent enough.
Therefore not all characters can be converted. Superman (DC Comics) is particularly inconsistent: by definition he is as strong
as he needs to be (and also as weak as he needs to be). Feats include lifting an infinitely heavy book, moving planets,
and struggling to lift a single ordinary crane. Go figure. There are also many other god-like characters with powers
that are simply not allowed. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is technically possible with enough points but The Infinity Gauntlet
(Marvel Comics) with its ability to change physics etc is not allowed. Also see <a href="../gamemastering/index.html#TOC-LOST-IN-TRANSLATION">
Lost In Translation</a> and <a href="known-issues.html">Known issues</a>.</p>
