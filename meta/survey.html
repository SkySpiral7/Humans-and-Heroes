<!--TODO: Consider making this a form with submit of mailto: if that works.
If not I could generate a link like I do in secret-origins/point-counter.html.
Either way the idea is to
mailto:rworcest@g.emporia.edu?subject=H%26H%20Survey&body=body%20with%0Aendline
-->
<p>If you play test this game I would appreciate it if you <a href="mailto:rworcest@g.emporia.edu">emailed me</a> feedback.
The survey here is to ask about the 2 items of concern I have: skill distance and combat. All questions are optional except:
What version did you play (provide the major and minor)?</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-3">Skills</h3>
<ul>
   <li>How often did you roll a skill check?</li>
   <li>Did you choose your skills from the <a href="../skills.html">skill</a> page when making your character?</li>
   <li>Did you tend to pick more narrow or broad skills?</li>
   <li>Was it a tough choice?</li>
   <li>Did you regret your choice?</li>
   <li>Do you think the skill distance penalty is balanced?</li>
   <li>Do you think narrow skills should even exist?</li>
   <li>What do you think about broad/narrow skills in general?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="generated-class-3">Combat</h3>
<ul>
   <li>When making your character did you choose your attacks and defenses?</li>
   <li>How often were you in combat?</li>
   <li>How many good guys/bad guys were typically in a fight excluding minions?</li>
   <li>About how many turns/rounds did combat take on average?</li>
   <li>Do you think this is too long or too short?</li>
   <li>Do you think the system is too lethal?</li>
   <li>Did you use any <a href="../action-adventure.html#TOC-MANEUVERS">maneuvers</a>/<a href="../action-adventure.html#TOC-ACTIONS">actions</a>?</li>
   <li>Did the emphasis on ranks (instead of luck) make combat seem hopeless, pointless, or just right?</li>
   <li>Do <a href="../action-adventure.html#TOC-MANEUVERS">maneuvers</a>/<a href="../action-adventure.html#TOC-ACTIONS">actions</a> help balance combat?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="generated-class-3">System Involvement</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Have you played M&amp;M 3e before?</li>
   <li>How much of H&amp;H did you read?</li>
   <li>Did you make your own character or use a prebuilt one (<a href="../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-ARCHETYPES">hero archtype</a>)?</li>
   <li>Do you prefer your system to have a rule for everything or would you rather have more of a lose outline?</li>
   <li>Do you prefer your system to be as realistic as possible?</li>
   <li>Do you like superheroes?</li>
   <li>Do you like the idea of a universal system?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="generated-class-3">Your Gamemaster</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Had the GM played or ran M&amp;M 3e before?</li>
   <li>How much of H&amp;H did the GM read?</li>
   <li>Was the GM more mechanic or narrative focused?</li>
   <li>Did the GM seem to know how to run the system or did he have to look things up or make guesses?</li>
   <li>How experienced was your GM in general?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="generated-class-3">Your Game</h3>
<ul>
   <li>How many protagonists were there?</li>
   <li>What <a href="../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL">power level</a> were your characters? (probably 10)</li>
   <li>Was there any point where a character (whose stats actually mattered) had a power level of at least 20?
   I hope <a href="../gamemastering.html#TOC-GODHOOD">transcendence</a> wasn't involved: those rules need an overhaul.</li>
   <li>What <a href="../gamemastering.html#TOC-STYLE">style</a> was the game: Light (which is 4-color), Dark, or Grayscale?</li>
   <li>Did you enjoy the game overall?</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to say anything else: complain, compliment, suggest, or whatever.</p>
