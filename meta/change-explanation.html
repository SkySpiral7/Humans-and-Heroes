<h1>CHANGE EXPLANATION</h1>
<p>This page was supposed to include a list of reasons behind every single change but screw that. Instead this is
a short list of reasons for some changes. If you are determined to get a full change list then
<a href="https://github.com/SkySpiral7/Humans-and-Heroes/commits/gh-pages/minorVersion.js" target="_new">click here</a>.</p>
<h2>MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES</h2>
<p><a href="../character-creation/powers/effects/remote-sensing.html">Remote Sensing</a> was changed so that you
can only use it on places that are well-known to prevent people from seeing on the other side of a wall that can't be
seen through with <a href="../character-creation/powers/effects/senses.html#TOC-PENETRATES-CONCEALMENT">Penetrates Concealment
(Vision)</a>. I also moved the ability to "feel" it to the <b>Noticeable</b> flaw to better reflect real life: if
someone is nearby and watching you, you can pick up on subtle hints from peripheral vision etc but if someone is far
away watching with a telescope or hidden camera there is no way to detect it. And since <a href="../character-creation/powers/effects/remote-sensing.html">Remote Sensing</a>
is like a telescope there should not be anyway to notice it by default.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DICE-CHANGE">DICE CHANGE</h2>
<p>Anyone who has played Mutants &amp; Masterminds 3rd edition (the one this is based on) will notice that I changed it
from a d20 system to a 3dF. The reason is the ranks and measurements table used: each rank represents double the value
of the previous. So in the M&amp;M 3e if an average adult (strength 0) rolled a strength check to lift a heavy object he
has a 5% chance to multiply his normal strength by 2^20 (by rolling a 20) which is a difference between lifting 50
pounds and 26,000 tons: this is absurd. He's got average human strength he shouldn't be able to do this! That's one
reason why I changed to 3dF so that he only has a 4% chance to get +3 (ignoring critical) that's only 8 times as strong
which is still hard to believe but much more realistic.</p>
<p>Switching to 3dF puts much more emphasis on ranks than on luck, as it should since each rank is doubly effective.
Since fudge dice also have negative numbers they represent doing worse than average where your rank represents your
average instead of being your average -10. Six sided dice are also much cheaper and easier to get a hold of so that
substitutions can be made, as opposed to not having a d20 in which case software is the only possible substitute. And the last
reason to use 3dF is that it has a bell curve which is usually 0, indeed most rolls should be +0 by definition of being
your average, 1d20 does not have an average for a single roll.</p>
<h2>WILL DEFENSE RANT</h2>
<p>I changed Will defense from using Awareness to Presence. This is an easy change to defend. I'll start
with a description of each.</p>
<p><b>Awareness</b>: Awareness describes common sense and intuition, what some might call "wisdom." Simply put it is
your ability to sense what is going on. Your Awareness modifier applies to Insight and Perception skill checks.
<b>Presence</b>: Presence is force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability. Your Presence modifier
applies to Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion skill checks. <b>Will defense</b>: It measures mental stability,
level-headedness, determination, self-confidence, self-awareness, and willpower, used to resist mental or spiritual
attacks.</p>
<p>Notice how each of those terms for Will defense fit better for Presence than Awareness, even self-awareness, despite
the name, is more about internal awareness instead of external awareness and is a part of personality all are traits of
Presence. In essence Awareness is for senses Presence is free will and force of will, obviously Presence should be the
one that resists a mental attack.</p>
<p>I think I know why Will defense was using Awareness is because it was based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons which uses the
equivalent Wisdom. But D&amp;D has more of a reason for using Wisdom because most Will saves are defending against magic
and magic or spiritual attacks are more about Wisdom than Charisma. But even then Will saves (and Will defense) are more
about force of will than about spiritual awareness etc so it should still be Charisma which, according to Charisma
casters, is force of will which would also make Charisma not useless but I'm getting off topic.</p>
