<h1 class="page-header-red">SUPPLEMENTARY RULES</h1>
<p>This page contains additional details and extra rules. Basically it contains anything that I started to ramble off
topic about. The order they are listed is small ones alphabetically then the large ones alphabetically.</p>
<p><b>Catching</b>: Catching a falling person or object requires a Dexterity check (DC -1). If you
successfully catch a falling object, subtract your Strength rank from the falling damage rank. Both you and the object
suffer any remaining damage. So if a character with Strength 5 catches someone falling for 12 damage, subtract 5 from
12, and both characters resist damage 7. If the catcher is using a power--such as <b>Flight</b> or <b>Move
Object</b>--to catch the falling object, the power's rank can be substituted for Strength at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p><b>Lasting Injuries</b>: If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game,
or just in a particular story, they are better handled as complications (see the <b>Complications</b> section in <a
href="../gameplay/the-basics.html">The Basics</a> for details). This is largely how the comics handle them; most of the time, heroes
bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and significant injury--such as
a broken arm or head trauma--that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other GM-imposed
complication: award the player a victory point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication to the
story. Use the conditions defined in <a href="../gameplay/the-basics.html">The Basics</a> as an idea of the complications facing an
injured character.</p>
