Humans & Heroes
===============
Add this H&H Survey:
How often did you roll a skill check?
Did you choose your skills from the skill page when making your character?
Did you tend to pick more narrow or broad skills?
Was it a tough choice?
Did you regret your choice?
Do you think the skill distance penalty is balanced?
Do you think narrow skills should even exist?
What do you think about broad/narrow skills in general?

When making your character did you choose your attacks and defenses?
How often were you in combat?
How many good guys/bad guys were typically in a fight excluding minions?
About how many turns did combat take on average?
Do you think this is too long or too short?
Do you think the system is too lethal?
Did you use any maneuvers/actions?
Did the emphasis on ranks (instead of luck) make combat seem hopeless, pointless, or just right?
Do maneuvers/actions help balance combat?

Have you played M&M 3e before?
How much of H&H did you read?
Did you make your own character or use a prebuilt one (archtype)?
Do you prefer your system to have a rule for everything or would you rather have more of a lose outline?
Do you prefer your system to be as realistic as possible?
Do you like superheroes?
Do you like the idea of a universal system?

Had the GM played or ran M&M 3e before?
How much of H&H did the GM read?
Was the GM more mechanic or narrative focused?
Did the GM seem to know how to run the system or did he have to look things up or make guesses?
How experienced was your GM in general?

How many protagonists were there?
What power level were your characters? (probably 10)
Was there any point where a character (whose stats actually mattered) had a power level of at least 20? I hope transcendence wasn't involved: those rules need an overhaul.
(Take a look at gamemastering.html "CREATING A SERIES") what style was the game: Light (which is 4-color), Dark, or Grayscale?
Did you enjoy the game overall?

Feel free to say anything else. Complain, compliment, suggest, or whatever.
