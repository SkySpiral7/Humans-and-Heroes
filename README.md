Humans & Heroes
===============
This repository is a tabletop game forked from the Open Game Content portions of Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.
Which is legal (see open-game-license.html for details).

The gh-pages branch has stable rules and should be the one used when playing the game.
If any other branch exists it will be for H&H 4 and will be in alpha until merged into gh-pages.
Also note that if such a branch exists it will likely be the only one maintained.

There is a sidebar which connects the pages. In this way all pages can be reached without needing to open the file system
directories. Likewise there are a few pages that are not linked to, they exist for reference and do not contain rules.

**H&H Version 1** is a copy of the rules for Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.

**H&H Version 2** makes many changes and uses a single 20 sided dice for the core mechanic (like M&M 3e).

**H&H Version 3** makes many changes and uses 3 fudge dice for the core mechanic.

**H&H Version 4** (currently no plan of doing) would need to overhaul the ranks: linear and quadratic

The minor version numbers originally represented the number of times I distributed it.
Minor version numbers now count the number of commits which change rules. The commit hash could also be used as reference.

As stated in the first paragraph of The Basics (the-basics.html):
This code was copied from [The d20 Hero SRD](www.d20herosrd.com) using the tool [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/).
The original site is owned by John Reyst and the modifications were done by Ryan Worcester.
I wasn't granted permission to use the CSS or the images.
Note that the original website has since changed so that it now contains other free information not just the M&M 3e core rules.

Add this H&H Survey:
How often did you roll a skill check?
Did you choose your skills from the skill page when making your character?
Did you tend to pick more narrow or broad skills?
Was it a tough choice?
Did you regret your choice?
Do you think the skill distance penalty is balanced?
Do you think narrow skills should even exist?
What do you think about broad/narrow skills in general?

When making your character did you choose your attacks and defenses?
How often were you in combat?
How many good guys/bad guys were typically in a fight excluding minions?
About how many turns did combat take on average?
Do you think this is too long or too short?
Do you think the system is too lethal?
Did you use any maneuvers/actions?
Did the emphasis on ranks (instead of luck) make combat seem hopeless, pointless, or just right?
Do maneuvers/actions help balance combat?

Have you played M&M 3e before?
How much of H&H did you read?
Did you make your own character or use a prebuilt one (archtype)?
Do you prefer your system to have a rule for everything or would you rather have more of a lose outline?
Do you prefer your system to be as realistic as possible?
Do you like superheroes?
Do you like the idea of a universal system?

Had the GM played or ran M&M 3e before?
How much of H&H did the GM read?
Was the GM more mechanic or narrative focused?
Did the GM seem to know how to run the system or did he have to look things up or make guesses?
How experienced was your GM in general?

How many protagonists were there?
What power level were your characters? (probably 10)
Was there any point where a character (whose stats actually mattered) had a power level of at least 20? I hope transcendence wasn't involved: those rules need an overhaul.
(Take a look at gamemastering.html "CREATING A SERIES") what style was the game: Light (which is 4-color), Dark, or Grayscale?
Did you enjoy the game overall?

Feel free to say anything else. Complain, compliment, suggest, or whatever.
