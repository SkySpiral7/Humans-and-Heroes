Humans & Heroes
===============
This repository is a tabletop game forked from Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.
Which is legal due to their Open Game License.

The master branch has stable rules (and is not being updated) the wip branch is converting from d20 to 3dF.
But the conversion is not yet finished so some pages are still d20 thus the rules are unstable and unusable.

There is a sidebar which connects the pages. In this way all pages can be reached without needing to open the file system
directories. Likewise there are a few pages that are not linked to, they exist for reference and do not contain rules.

**H&H Version 1** is a copy of the rules for Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.

**H&H Version 2** makes many changes and uses a single 20 sided dice for the core mechanic (like M&M 3e).

**H&H Version 3** makes many changes and uses 3 fudge dice for the core mechanic.

The minor version numbers originally represented the number of times I distributed it.
Minor version numbers no longer exist, use the commit hash as reference instead.
Therefore if you have a version that is 2.x but is not 2.5 then your version is obsolete.
Version 3 is still in alpha until the rules are fully converted.

As stated in the first paragraph of 1: The Basics (home.html):
This code was copied from [The d20 Hero SRD](www.d20herosrd.com) using the tool [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/).
The original site is owned by John Reyst and the modifications were done by Ryan Worcester.
I wasn't granted permission to use the css or the images.
Note that the original website has since changed so that it now contains other free information not just the M&M core rules.
