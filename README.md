Humans & Heroes
===============
This repository is a tabletop game forked from the Open Game Content portions of Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.
Which is legal (see open-game-license.html for details).

The gh-pages branch has stable rules and should be the one used when playing the game.
If any other branch exists it will be for H&H 4 and will be in alpha until merged into gh-pages.
Also note that if such a branch exists it will likely be the only one maintained.

There is a sidebar which connects the pages. In this way all pages can be reached without needing to open the file system
directories. Likewise there are a few pages that are not linked to, they exist for reference and do not contain rules.

**H&H Version 1** is a copy of the rules for Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.

**H&H Version 2** makes many changes and uses a single 20 sided dice for the core mechanic (like M&M 3e).

**H&H Version 3** makes many changes and uses 3 fudge dice for the core mechanic.

**H&H Version 4** (currently no plan of doing) would need to overhaul the ranks: linear and quadratic

The minor version numbers originally represented the number of times I distributed it.
Minor version numbers now count the number of commits. The commit hash could also be used as reference.

As stated in the first paragraph of 1: The Basics (1-the-basics.html):
This code was copied from [The d20 Hero SRD](www.d20herosrd.com) using the tool [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/).
The original site is owned by John Reyst and the modifications were done by Ryan Worcester.
I wasn't granted permission to use the CSS or the images.
Note that the original website has since changed so that it now contains other free information not just the M&M 3e core rules.
